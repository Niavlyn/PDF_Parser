ABSTRACT: Once one of the most common cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea, the short-beaked
common dolphin has declined throughout the region since the 1960s and in 2003 this population was
classified  as  Endangered  in  the  International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature  (IUCN)  Red  List.
Here, we document the species’ precipitous decline in eastern Ionian Sea coastal waters across 13 yr.
While 150 animals were present in the study area (1050 km2) in 1996, only 15 were observed in 2007.
A 12 mo assessment of fishing effort and catch, together with circumstantial evidence, suggests that
the  decline  was  caused  largely  by  prey  depletion  resulting  from  overfishing.  We  analyzed  the
impacts of various fishing gear and estimated the degree of resource overlap between common dol-
phins and local fisheries. The total biomass removed annually by 308 fishing boats in the study area
averaged 3571 t, while that consumed by common dolphins was 17 t. Resource overlap between com-
mon dolphins and fisheries — expressed as an average Pianka index of 0.5 — differed according to
fishing gear, being higher for purse seiners (0.7) and beach seiners (0.4) and lower for bottom trawlers
(0.1),  trammel  boats  (0.2)  and  longliners  (0.0).  Only  about  10  active  purse  seiners  (4%  of  the  total
active fishing fleet) were responsible for 33% of the biomass removal, and likely had the greatest
impact on prey of common dolphins. This study indicates a high risk of local disappearance of com-
mon dolphins in the very near future, unless fishery management measures are implemented imme-
diately. Purse seining should be the main management target.

INTRODUCTION

Once  one  of  the  most  common  cetacean  species  in
the Mediterranean Sea, the short-beaked common dol-
phin  Delphinus  delphis has  declined  throughout  the
region since the 1960s (Bearzi et al. 2003). In 2003, the
Mediterranean  population  was  classified  as  Endan-
gered  in  the  International  Union  for  Conservation  of
Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, based
on  observed  declines  in  the  number  of  animals  and
extent  of  occurrence,  as  well  as  deterioration  in  the
quality  of  habitat  in  large  portions  of  the  Mediter-
ranean.  In  2005,  Mediterranean  common  dolphins
were listed in Appendix I and II of the Convention on
the Conservation of Migratory Species (Bonn Conven-

tion,  CMS).  While  it  would  be  difficult  to  imagine  a
more favourable legal and international framework to
support action in the region, conservation of common
dolphins has remained ‘on paper’ (Bearzi 2007).

Although much of the Mediterranean basin has not
been  surveyed,  there  is  clear  evidence  of  population
decline  in  portions  where  detailed  studies  have  been
conducted, e.g. the northern Adriatic Sea (Bearzi et al.
2004a)  and  the  Gulf  of  Vera  in  southern  Spain
(Cañadas & Hammond 2007). Here, we document the
precipitous,  ongoing  decline  of  common  dolphins  in
eastern Ionian Sea coastal waters across 13 yr. Also, we
show that the decline suggested previously for a core
area of 480 km2 between 1997 and 2004 (Bearzi et al.
2005, 2006) has occurred over a wider area (1050 km2)

Survey  and  photo-identification  effort.  Surveys
were conducted ad libitum from 4.7 to 5.8 m inflatable
craft with rigid hulls powered by 50 to 100 HP 4-stroke
outboard engines from 1995 to 2007. The survey cover-
age totalled 34 801 km on effort and 908 survey days,
from May to September each year (Table 1). Surveys
were conducted at speeds between 28 and 36 km h–1
under consistently good conditions: unimpaired visibil-
ity, sea state ≤1 Douglas with no swell, and at least 2
experienced  observers  scanning  the  sea  surface  (eye
elevation of approximately 2 m). Such conditions char-
acterize ‘on effort’ in Table 1.

Photo-identification  of  individuals.  Colour  photo-
graphs suitable for individual identification, based on
long-term  natural  marks  on  the  dolphins’  dorsal  fins
(Würsig & Würsig 1977, Neumann et al. 2002), were ob-
tained on 356 d. On each encounter with a group of dol-
phins, as many good photographs as possible were taken
of all individuals present. Photo-identification was per-
formed following Würsig & Jefferson (1990), with cam-
eras equipped with 70 to 200 mm f2.8 zoom lenses, using
100 ISO colour transparency film from 1995 to 2002, and
digital photography from 2003 to 2007. Considering that
digital  photography  substantially  improves  the  effi-

and a longer time interval (1995 to 2007). Bearzi et al.
(2006) discussed  possible  reasons  for  the  observed
declines  of  common  dolphins  and  other  megafauna
that  prey  on  epipelagic  schooling  fish  and  concluded
that  the  most  likely  cause  of  the  declines  was  prey
depletion as a result of fishing pressure. Here, we pro-
vide quantitative data on fishing effort and landings in
the  Kalamos  area,  and  we  link  these  data  to  the  on-
going  local  decline  of  common  dolphins  (and  other
megafauna). Our 12 mo assessment is consistent with
the  hypothesis  that  ecosystem  damage  has  been
caused by unsustainable fishing (Stergiou et al. 1997,
2007b).

Eastern Ionian Sea waters surrounding the island of
Kalamos have been included by the Hellenic Ministry of
the Environment in the Natura 2000 network (‘Sites of
Community Importance’) under the 9243 EEC ‘Habitats’
Directive. In 2002 the Agreement on the Conservation of
Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and con-
tiguous  Atlantic  area  (ACCOBAMS),  ratified  by
Greece, identified the area of Kalamos as one where pi-
lot conservation and management actions should be de-
veloped and implemented immediately to preserve the
habitat of common dolphins. In 2004, the Contracting
Parties  to  ACCOBAMS  ‘welcomed’  a
Conservation  Plan  for  Mediterranean
common  dolphins 
identified
Kalamos as an Area of Conservation Im-
portance (Bearzi et al. 2004b).

that 

The  study  presented  here  (1)  indi-
cates that there is a high risk that com-
mon  dolphins  will  disappear  from  the
Kalamos  area  in  the  very  near  future
and  (2)  identifies  fishery  management
measures  that  must  be  implemented
immediately  to  prevent  the  further
decline of common dolphins and deteri-
oration of the local ecosystem.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study  area.  The  study  area,  situated
in eastern Ionian Sea coastal waters, in-
cludes  the  Ionian  islands  of  Meganisi,
Kalamos and Kastos and covers 1050 km2
of  sea  surface  (Fig.  1).  The  sea  floor  is
mostly  50  to  250  m  deep,  with  rocky
coasts and shallows covered by seagrass
meadows. Waters are transparent (Sec-
chi  disk  readings  ranging  between  10
and 30 m) and oligotrophic (Gotsis-Skre-
tas  &  Ignatiades  2007),  and  river  and
agricultural runoff is insignificant (Pitta
et al. 1998).

ciency of individual dolphin identification (Markowitz et
al. 2003), transparencies were scanned at high resolution
and turned into digital images for consistency of evalua-
tion and analysis. Photos were then cropped around the
dorsal fin and visible part of the body and selected using
consistent criteria (i.e. entire dorsal fin visible, fin per-
pendicular to camera, high sharpness and resolution, no
water spray masking fin profile), based on recommenda-
tions provided by Read et al. (2003). Following such se-
lection,  the  catalogue  included  13 319  transparencies
and 4290 digital photos, totalling 17 609 dorsal fin pho-
tos. These images were then matched, and the identified
animals were included in a database. Only individuals
with distinctive dorsal fin profiles, bearing marks suit-
able for reliable long-term identification from either side
of the fin, were used for mark-recapture analyses. The
characteristic white patch present on both sides of the fin
of some animals could be used to confirm a match (Neu-
mann et al. 2002, Bearzi et al. 2005) but not as a distinc-
tive feature. Individuals with a single tiny nick or no nick
on the dorsal fin’s trailing edge, and individuals judged
to be recognizable only based on dorsal fin shape and/or

temporary  scars  were  not  used  in  the
analyses, as their inclusion could result
in borderline or incorrect matches and
thus violate one or more mark-recap-
ture  assumptions.  Patterns  of  site  fi-
delity  implied  by  photo-identification
data  (Fig.  2,  where  information  from
1993 and1994 is also shown) and indi-
vidual movements indicated by recor-
dings of boat position (used as a proxy
for dolphin  position)  at  6  min  inter-
vals during photo-identification follows
(Fig.  3),  assisted  in the  selection  of
the most appropriate model for mark-
recapture analyses.

Mark-recapture  analyses.  Mark-
recapture methods rely on the number
of  animals  marked  and  their  propor-
tion  in  subsequent  samples  to  esti-
mate population  parameters,  includ-
ing abundance (Seber 1982). Since the
1980s  these  methods  have  been  used
widely  to  estimate  abundance  of  cer-
tain cetacean species based on photo-
graphic  records  of  naturally  marked
individuals  (Hammond  1990,  Ham-
mond  et  al.  1990,  Wilson  et  al.  1999).
Pollock’s robust design (Pollock 1982)
with  Huggins  estimator  has  been  the
preferred model. Previous work in the
Kalamos  area  showed  that  this  popu-
lation  of  common  dolphins  could  be
regarded  as  open  among  years  and
closed within each annual sampling interval of 3 to 5
mo  (Table  1),  based  on  a  high  degree  of  site  fidelity,
individual movement patterns, and low rates of immi-
gration (Bearzi et al. 2005). The programme Mark 4.3
(http://www.warnercnr.colostate.edu/~gwhite/mark/
mark.htm)  was  used  for  mark-recapture  abundance
estimation.

Monitoring fishing effort and landings. Prior to this
study it had been difficult to document fishing pressure
in the study area due to (1) poor reliability of the land-
ing data (Watson & Pauly 2001) — a well-known prob-
lem  in  the  wider  Mediterranean  and  in  the  Hellenic
Seas  in  particular  (Stergiou  et  al.  1997,  1998,  Briand
2000) — and  (2)  the  fact  that  local  fishermen  often
deliberately misreport their catches with the intention
of  reducing  taxation  or  avoiding  stricter  regulations
(Bearzi  et  al.  2006).  Estimation  of  biomass  removal  is
essential to assess the impact of fisheries (Pitcher et al.
2002).  As  reliable  data  on  fishing  effort  and  fishery
landings were unavailable, we incorporated in our dol-
phin study a monitoring component aimed at obtaining
direct information on fishing within the study area.

In November 2006, we started a programme to mon-
itor  the  local  fishing  fleet  in  all  16  ports  and  other
mooring/landing sites (Fig. 1). All sites were monitored
once  per  month  on  days  of  bad  sea  state  conditions
and/or on Sundays, i.e. on days with a relatively high
probability  that  the  whole  fishing  fleet  would  be
moored or in port. A total of 324 fishing boats were cat-
alogued.  Classification  of  fishing  boats  and  gear  was
based on Nedelec & Prado (1990). The activity status of
each boat was recorded visually every month based on
fishing gear on board or near the boat’s mooring place,
fishermen  working  on  board,  boat  conditions,  and
direct inquiries. The local fishing fleet — i.e. the boats
recorded as active in any given month during the study
period — included 12 purse seiners (of which 11 were
15 to 25 m and 1 was 12 m long), 24 beach seiners of
8 to 12 m, 9 bottom trawlers of 20 to 25 m, 50 longliners
(29 of 4 to 7 m and 21 of 7 to 10 m), and 213 trammel
boats (98 of 4 to 7 m and 115 of 7 to 12 m). Boats shorter
than  4  m  were  not  considered,  as  their  impact  was
assumed negligible. For the same reason a total of 16
boats 4 to 7 m long equipped with gas-powered lamps
and  tridents/harpoons  were  also  excluded  from  the
analyses. Some boats had multiple gears and switched
from  one  fishing  method  to  another  depending  on
seasonal  closures  (Kapantagakis  2007).  For  instance,
most beach seiners operated as trammel boats during
months  of  beach  seining  closure.  Therefore,  active
boats  were  classified  according  to  the  gear  used  in
each month of sampling (e.g. a boat could be scored as
a purse seiner in September and as a bottom trawler in
October,  depending  on  the  gear  used  during  those
months).

Landings of purse seiners, beach seiners and bottom
trawlers were monitored between November 2006 and
October 2007. A total of 26 landings were recorded for
purse seiners (2.9 ± 1.9 mo–1, mean ± SD), 14 for beach
seiners  (2.3  ± 3.78  mo–1),  and  16  for  bottom  trawlers
(2.0 ± 1.31 mo–1). Total catch by species was recorded
visually by trained researchers based on the number of
full  boxes  landed  (boxes  were  routinely  divided  by
species before landing). Full boxes were estimated to
average  10  kg  irrespective  of  species  (an  assumption
routinely  used  for  market  purposes  at  landing  sites,
confirmed by direct observations). Days of activity per
month  per  boat  for  purse  seiners,  beach  seiners  and
bottom  trawlers  were  based  on  Kapantagakis  et  al.
(2001),  also  taking  into  account  periods  of  seasonal
fishing  closure.  Average  catch  for  trammel  boats  and
longliners was estimated as 3.42 t yr–1 for boats 4 to 7 m
long, and 6.31 t yr–1 for boats 8 to 11 m long (Stergiou
et al. 2007c). Percentage catch contribution of the most
abundant  species  for  longliners  and  trammel  boats
operating in the Ionian Sea was based on Stergiou et
al. (2007a). Discard rates were assumed to be 14% for

purse  seiners  (Tsimenides  et  al.  1995 — a  value
reported  as  likely  to  be  an  underestimate),  28%  for
beach  seiners  (Stergiou  et  al.  1996),  39%  for  bottom
trawlers (Machias et al. 2001) and 9.8% for netters and
longliners (Stergiou et al. 2002, Tzanatos et al. 2007).
Biomass  removed  annually  by  fisheries — calculated
separately according to fishing gear—was the product
of  average  daily  catch  per  boat,  days  of  activity  per
month,  number  of  boats  recorded  as  active  in  each
month of sampling, and months of fishing activity.

Resource overlap. To assess the similarity of biomass
composition between common dolphin prey and fish-
ery  catches,  we  used  Pianka’s  niche  overlap  index
(a measure  of  resource  overlap  between  2  species;
Pianka 1973, Pusineri et al. 2004):

where Pij is the percentage of prey item i of predator j,
and Pik is the percentage of prey item i of predator k.
The index ranges between 0 and 1, and the similarity is
higher the closer the index is to 1.

While  the  precise  diet  composition  of  common  dol-
phins in the study area is not known, diet preferences
were  inferred  from  (1)  stomach  contents  of  dead  ani-
mals in the study area (Bearzi 2000) and in neritic habi-
tat elsewhere (reviewed in Bearzi et al. 2003, Cañadas
2006), (2) observations of common dolphin feeding be-
haviour and diving patterns in the study area (Bearzi et
al.  2005),  (3)  direct  observations  of  feeding  in  neritic
Mediterranean  waters  (Mussi  &  Miragliuolo 2003,
Cañadas 2006), and (4) analysis of fish scales sampled
during  surface  feeding  by  common  dolphins  in  the
study area (Agazzi et al. 2004, Bearzi et al. 2006). Based
on this information, we assumed an average diet to be
composed  of  80%  Clupeidae  and  Engraulidae,  10%
Belonidae, Gadidae and small Carangidae, 5% Lolig-
inidae, and 5% other families (Table 2). Average daily
food consumption was estimated as 4.2 kg animal–1 us-
ing IB = 0.123M0.8 (Innes et al. 1987), where IB is the in-
gested  biomass  (kg  d–1)  and  M  the  body  mass  in  kg.
Body mass of common dolphins in the central Mediter-
ranean averages 82.5 kg according to Cagnolaro et al.
(1983).  The  body  mass  of  juveniles  was  estimated  as
50% of adult mass; nursing calves were not considered.

recapture  estimates  could  be  obtained  in  2006  (5  en-
counters)  and  2007  (4  encounters)  due  to  insufficient
recapture events in different months. However, owing
to the small group sizes and small number of encoun-
ters,  all  animals  sighted  during  those  years  were
photo-identified.  There  were  12  marked  animals  in
2006 and 9 in 2007 (Fig. 4).

As mark-recapture estimates relied on natural mark-
ings  to  identify  individuals,  they  refer  exclusively  to
the  population  of  marked  animals.  To  include  the
unmarked  portion  and  estimate  total  abundance,  the
proportion  of  unmarked 
individuals  (which  also
included  subadult  classes)  was  computed  based  on
the number of photographs of marked and unmarked
dorsal fins obtained daily (Williams et al. 1993, Bearzi
et  al.  2008).  Based  on  1858  high-quality  dorsal  fin
photos  taken  in  1997  (the  year  with  greatest  photo-
identification effort), the mean proportion of unmarked
animals in the population was 0.44 (95% CI = 0.382 to
0.494,  n =  74).  By  adding  this  mean  proportion  of

unmarked individuals to the mark-recapture estimate,
we obtained estimates of total population size (Fig. 4).
Even  though  mark-recapture  analyses  were  pre-
cluded in 2006 and 2007 by insufficient recaptures in
those years, encounters were so few (Table 1), groups
so small (range 2 to 9), and photo-identification effort
so  extensive  that  we  had  confidence  in  our  ability  to
count  and  photograph  all  individuals  present  during
the  sightings.  Direct  counts  of  total  animals  photo-
graphed (18 individuals in 2006, 15 in 2007) were con-
sistent  with  values  obtained  by  adding  the  estimated
unmarked  animals  to  the  number  of  marked  animals
(21  individuals  in  2006,  16  in  2007),  but  field  counts
appeared to be the most accurate and were therefore
used  to  complement  information  obtained  through
mark-recapture (Fig. 4).

The  observed  patterns  of  site  fidelity  (Fig.  2)  and
dolphin  movement  (Fig.  3)  suggest  that  the  decline
indicated by the mark-recapture analysis applies to the
entire local population of common dolphins.

Impact of fishing and resource overlap

Landings by purse seiners averaged 706.2 kg (SD =
967.91, n = 26, range 0 to 4030). Species landed were
predominantly  horse  mackerel  Trachurus  trachurus
(26.2% of the total catch), European pilchard Sardina
pilchardus (23.1%), bogue Boops boops (15.8%), Euro-
pean mackerel Scomber scombrus (11.2%), round sar-

Estimates of the total biomass removed by the local
fishing  fleet  between  November  2006  and  October
2007 and a comparison of the relative impact of differ-
ent  fishing  boats  are  shown  in  Table  3,  taking  into
account days of inactivity and discards (see ‘Materials
and  methods’).  The  estimated  total  biomass  removed
by  local  fisheries  was  3571  t.  A  Pianka’s  index  of  0.5
reflects  the  likely  present  overall  degree  of  resource
overlap between common dolphins and fisheries in the
study area (Table 2). Resource overlap differed accord-
ing to fishing gear, being 0.7 for purse seiners, 0.4 for
beach seiners, 0.1 for bottom trawlers, 0.2 for trammel

boats, and 0.0 for longliners (Fig. 5). The apparent lack
of  resource  overlap  between  common  dolphins  and
longliners  is  consistent  with  the  catch  composition
observed in the Cyclades Islands (Stergiou et al. 2002)
and  in  the  Patraikos  Gulf  (Tzanatos  et  al.  2006).  The
biomass consumed by 15 common dolphins estimated
to be present in the study area during the same time
interval was about 17 t (Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION

Once common and relatively abundant in the area of
Kalamos,  common  dolphins  have  declined  dramati-
cally  over  the  past  decade.  While  approximately  150
animals used the study area in 1996, only 15 were ob-
served in 2007. Tuna and swordfish also have declined
(Bearzi  et  al.  2006).  Large  tuna,  in  particular,  were
commonly encountered in the early years of the study
but were rarely seen after 2001. The decline of high-
order marine predators that feed on epipelagic prey is
consistent with the hypothesis that intensive exploita-
tion of epipelagic fish stocks reduced the availability of
key prey, making this coastal habitat less able to sus-
tain populations of large predators (Bearzi et al. 2006).
Other factors that might have played a significant role
include unrecognized oceanic changes, tissue contam-
ination by xenobiotic chemicals and incidental mortal-
ity  in  fishing  gear,  but  only  the  last  is  likely  to  have
been relevant. A local worker reported that 5 common
dolphins  with  mutilations  were  found  stranded  near
Paleros  between  December  2004  and  April  2005.  Of
those,  only  1  animal  could  be  exam-
ined and based on mutilation of its tail
flukes,  it  likely  died  in  fishing  gear
(Bearzi  2006).  No  other  reports  were
received  of  common  dolphin  bycatch
during the entire 15 yr study (1993 to
2007)  or  during  the  12  mo  of  fishery
monitoring. Also, floating carcasses of
common  dolphins  (possibly  indicative
of bycatch) were never observed over
a  total  of  1163  d  spent  at  sea  within
and around the study area since 1991,
totalling > 67 000 km of navigation. By-
catch is an important cause of mortal-
ity of common dolphins in some parts
of the world (Tregenza et al. 1997, Tre-
genza & Collet 1998, Julian & Beeson
1998)  and  it  may  have  contributed  to
the  observed  decline  in  common  dol-
phins  around  Kalamos.  However,  we
consider  it  unlikely  that  bycatch  was
the sole or even the main cause of the
decline.

As an alternative hypothesis, it is necessary to con-
sider  the  possibility  that  the  observed  trends  were  a
consequence of emigration or long-range movements.
However,  surveys  outside  the  study  area  have  pro-
vided no evidence to support the suggestion that com-
mon dolphins have shifted their distribution away from
the  Kalamos  area  (Bearzi  et  al.  2005).  This  area  has
been one of the few remaining pockets of high-density
occurrence in the central and eastern Mediterranean,
and there are few reports of common dolphins in sur-
rounding  areas.  Dedicated  cetacean  surveys  con-
ducted by the Tethys Research Institute in the Ionian
Sea  between  1991  and  2007,  covering  more  than
8200 km outside the Kalamos study area, produced no
sightings  of  common  dolphins.  Notwithstanding  sub-
stantial  dedicated  effort  by  several  research  groups,
only 3 sightings have been reported to date from east-
ern Ionian Sea waters outside the study area (1 in each
of 1992, 1995 and 1998; Angelici & Marini 1992, Politi
et  al.  1992,  Frantzis  et  al.  2003,  Gannier  2005).  Be-
tween  1999  and  2007,  common  dolphins  were  never
seen  north,  west  or  south  of  the  study  area  during
cetacean  surveys  totalling  tens  of  thousands  of  kilo-
metres of dedicated effort and covering large portions
of the eastern Ionian Sea, as well as waters west of the
Peloponnese  (Frantzis  et  al.  2003,  Lacey  et  al.  2005,
IFAW 2007, A. Frantzis pers. comm.). More generally,
common dolphins appear to be rare in, or absent from,
the adjacent central Mediterranean areas explored so
far,  including  the  Hellenic  Trench,  other  neritic  and
pelagic portions of the Ionian Sea, and the Adriatic Sea

(Notarbartolo di Sciara et al. 1993, Bearzi et al. 2003,
Frantzis  et  al.  2003,  Gannier  2005,  Lacey  et  al.  2005,
IFAW 2007), the only exception being the inner Gulf of
Corinth,  where  a  few  common  dolphins  remain
(Frantzis  &  Herzing  2002).  Recent  genetic  evidence
(Natoli et al. 2008) indicates a relatively high degree of
differentiation  among  common  dolphins  in  the  Medi-
terranean  and  shows  that  common  dolphins  in  the
eastern part of the basin, including the Ionian Sea, are
largely  isolated  from  the  western  Mediterranean
population.

Prey depletion caused by overfishing is thought to be
one of the main reasons behind the overall decline of
Mediterranean  common  dolphins  (Bearzi  et  al.  2003,
2004a,  Cañadas  &  Hammond  2007).  The  declines  in
fish  stocks  and  loss  of  marine  biodiversity  caused  by
fishing  pressure  are  a  growing  concern  worldwide
(Pauly  et  al.  1998,  2002,  Jackson  et  al.  2001,  Pitcher
2001,  Csirke  2005,  Worm  et  al.  2006).  Unsustainable
fishing  has  been  implicated  in  dramatic  ecological
changes in the Mediterranean Sea (Sala 2004), where
it has caused the decline of many fish stocks (Caddy &
Griffiths 1990, De Walle et al. 1993, Stanners & Bour-
deau  1995,  Caddy  1997,  Garcia  et  al.  2005).  Some  of
the  Mediterranean  fish  stocks  that  have  been  over-
exploited  include  important  prey  species  of  common
dolphins (Lleonart 2005).

While the impact of fishing remains to be assessed at
the  regional  scale,  there  is  ample  and  growing  evi-
dence  of  overfishing  in  the  Hellenic  Seas,  including
the eastern Ionian Sea. Around the island of Kalamos,

Bearzi et al: Common dolphin disappearance in western Greece

total  landings  have  decreased  since  the  mid  1980s
(Papaconstantinou et al. 1985, 1988, Papaconstantinou
& Stergiou 1995, Stergiou et al. 1997). European Com-
mission (EC) figures indicate that catch per day of both
demersal and pelagic resources has declined steeply in
the Hellenic Ionian Sea over the last decade (EC 2004).
In  the  eastern  Ionian  Sea,  in  particular,  purse  seine
catch per day of both anchovies and sardines declined
since  the  mid  1990s  (EC  2004),  especially  for  vessels
larger than 15 m, which account for the majority of the
catch  of  small  pelagic  fish  species  (Stergiou  et  al.
2007b).  The  long-term  increasing  trends  in  Hellenic
marine landings from 1964 to 1994, attributed to fleet
modernization  and  geographic  expansion  of  the  fish-
eries  over  this  period,  have  been  followed  since  the
mid 1990s by rapidly declining trends in landings and
yields,  suggesting  that  the  fishing  has  been  overly
intense, i.e. unsustainable (Stergiou et al. 1997, 2007b,
Stergiou 2005).

Overlap  between  dolphin  prey  species  and  fishery
target species — as indicated by the Pianka’s index —
does not prove direct competition (Briand 2004). How-
ever, it is reasonable to infer competitive effects when
key prey becomes scarce and remains subject to heavy
fishing  pressure  (Trites  et  al.  1997,  Kaschner  &  Pauly
2004, Pusineri et al. 2004). Around Kalamos, the poten-
tial for exploitative competition (Keddy 1989) between
high-order  predators  such  as  common  dolphins  and
local fisheries targeting their prey is apparent (Fig. 5).
Overfishing and destructive fishing methods affect not
only top predators, but also the fishery and in turn the
fishing  communities.  Though  it  was  not  possible  to
quantify  this  aspect  as  part  of  the  present  study  (cf.
Saenz-Arroyo  et  al.  2005),  local  artisanal  fishermen
consistently  lamented  the  declines  in  catches  and  re-
ported to our research team that the local marine eco-
system had become less productive in recent decades.
The  waters  around  Kalamos  are  an  important
spawning area for European pilchard (Somarakis et al.
2000, 2006a,b, Machias et al. 2007) and hake (Politou
et al. 2006, Politou 2007), making this Natura 2000 Site
of Community Importance a candidate for special pro-
tection  based  on  EC  Regulations  for  the  sustainable
exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean
(EC 2006). In addition to common dolphins, the area is
home  to  species  included  in  Annex  II  to  the  Habitats
Directive, including a resident community of common
bottlenose  dolphins  Tursiops  truncatus and  endan-
gered  species  such  as  the  Mediterranean  monk  seal
Monachus  monachus and  the  loggerhead  sea  turtle
Caretta caretta.

In view of the evidence provided here, and consider-
ing  the  existing  political  and  legal  commitments  to
conserve  cetaceans  and  preserve  marine  biodiversity
(see  ‘Introduction’)  (Owen  2004),  relevant  local,  na-

tional and regional governmental bodies are obliged to
take action to reduce fishing pressure and limit the use
of fishing gears that can have unintended harmful ef-
fects on the marine environment. Fishery management
measures are urgently needed to reduce current over-
exploitation and allow for the recovery of endangered
marine megafauna. Such measures should include the
following: (1) an immediate moratorium on purse sein-
ing, as advocated by the large local community of arti-
sanal  fishermen;  (2)  restrictions  on  bottom  trawling;
(3) strict enforcement and appropriate penalties for il-
legal fishing; and (4) full implementation of the Coun-
cil  Regulation  1967/2006,  which  also  demands  a  ban
on  beach  seining  by  May  31,  2010  (beach  seining  is
considered harmful to fish stocks and habitats and has
been  banned  in  most  EU  Countries).  As  EC  funding
tools  exist  to  compensate  the  affected  fisheries,  this
may  be  a  ‘win-win’  situation,  where  existing  regula-
tions can be effectively implemented to solve a specific
conservation problem, with the added value of protect-
ing marine biodiversity, ensuring continued ecosystem
services,  preserving  artisanal  fisheries,  and  bringing
long-term benefits to human society.
