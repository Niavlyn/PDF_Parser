Abstract 
 
As a source of starch, potato remains unexploited in Brazilian industries, where they typically utilize corn and cassava. Considering 
the emerging need for using potato as a source of commercial starch, this study evaluated starches extracted from seven cultivars 
of potatoes with limited commercial usage in Brazil. Potatoes were grown under the same environmental conditions and cultural 
practices.  After  harvesting,  the  potato  tubers  were  processed  for  the  extraction  of  starch.  The  proximate  composition,  amylose 
content,  resistant  starch,  minerals,  as  well  as  pasting  and  thermal  properties  of  extracted  starch  samples  were  analyzed.  Starch 
characteristics varied with the cultivar. Using correlation analysis, we demonstrated that minerals have a robust effect on starch 
characteristics.  Moreover,  positive  correlations  were  observed  between  phosphorus,  potassium,  magnesium,  resistant  starch, 
viscosity  peak,  breakdown,  and  gelatinization  enthalpy.  Calcium  had  a  positive  correlation  with  the  amylose  content  and  the 
percentage of starch retrogradation. Starch samples showed important differences in their physicochemical properties, which are 
advantageous for industrial applications allowing a larger diversification and incentive to the production of potato for industry in 
Brazil.

Introduction 
 

Agribusiness  in  the  major  industry  in  Brazil  as  a  result  of 
environmental characteristics, such as favorable climate, soil, 
water,  and  light  conditions.  Potato  is  a  horticultural  crop, 
which occupies the largest cultivation area in the country. The 
potato agribusiness involves approximately 5,000 producers in 
30  regions  of  seven  Brazilian  states,  and  the  majority  of  the 
national  production  is  commercialized  in  natura,  with  only 
10% being used for industrial processing, in the form of frozen 
potato and potato chips (Santos et al. 2016; Faostat, 2017).  
Potato contains approximately 18% dry matter, of which 80% 
is starch (Braun et al. 2011; Evangelista et al. 2011). Starch is 
an  excellent  source  of  carbohydrates,  used  by  all  countries 
with increasing consumption rates, as the country develops. In 
Brazil, approximately 1 million ton of starch is produced from 
maize  and  cassava,  which  accounts  for  a  turnover  of 
approximately 500 million dollars. This industrial turnover can 
be further increased, significantly, if the unexploited potential 
of other starch sources is considered. 
Starch, a source of renewable energy, has been extracted with 
high  purity  from  several  plants  for  commercial  purposes  via 

relatively simple industrial processes; widely used by-products 
can  be  obtained  from  starch  using  chemical,  physical,  and 
intensive 
enzymatic  processes.  Thus,  there  have  been 
advances in the knowledge about this polymer in recent years, 
signifying  the  great  potential  of  technological  innovations  in 
the agroindustry starch sector (Mesquita et al. 2016). 
Due  to  the  high  demand  of  starch,  for  varied  uses,  the 
potential  unmodified  starches  for  industrial  production  are 
selected  using  two  important  criteria:  agricultural  availability 
and  productivity;  and  the  unique  characteristics  of  each 
starch–physical  and  chemical  properties  (Matsuguma  et  al. 
2009). 
following 
This 
considerations:  1)  Brazil  has  the  agroindustrial  potential  to 
produce  starch  from  different  sources  and  supply  it  to  the 
world market; 2)despite agriculturally producing considerable 
amounts  of  potatoes,  Brazil  imports  starch;  3)  currently,  the 
majority  of  potato  cultivars  in  Brazil  are  primarily  from 
Europe,  making  studies  with  potatoes  of  various  origins  very 
important  for  increasing  the  industrialization  of  this  tuber; 

study  was  designed  based  on

and4)  the  availability  of  industrial  infrastructure  in  Brazilto 
extract starch from corn and cassava.  
Thus,  this  study  aimed  at  processing  seven  potato  cultivars 
that  are  still  commercially  unexploited,  to  evaluate  the 
physicochemical  parameters  of  their  starches,  such  as 
proximate  composition,  amylose  mineral  content,  and 
thermal  and  pasting  properties  and  to  provide  useful 
information to the Brazilian agroindustrial industry.  
 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Chemical composition 
 
Purity  is  an  important  quality  parameter  for  the  industrial 
production  of  starch.  Results  of  the  characterization  of  the 
starches  extracted 
in 
compliance  with  the  requirements  for  commercialization  as 
native  starch. 
In  addition,  the  sum  of  the  non-starch 
components  does  not  exceed  1.2%,  indicating  high  purity 
(Table 2). 
In  comparison  to  the  starches  isolated  from  other  plants, 
potato  starch  contains  high  amount  of  starch-bound 
phosphates (Blennow et al., 2002; Noda et al., 2007; Leonel et 
al.,  2016).  Furthermore,  potato  starch  naturally  contains 
metal  cations  that  are  bound  to  the  phosphate  ester  groups 
through ionic forces (Zaidul et al., 2007; Noda et al., 2014). 
The  results  obtained  from  the  analysis  of  phosphorus, 
potassium,  calcium,  and  magnesium  contents  in  the  starches 
showed  significant  differences  among  the  potato  cultivars 
(Table 2). The starches obtained from Harley Blackhell, Marcy, 
and  Snowden  cultivars  showed  high  levels  of  these  minerals. 
The phosphorous content in potato starches was found to be 
the  highest,  of  all  analyzed  minerals,  also  in  agreement  with 
the observation by Zaidul et al. (2007). 
enzymatically 
starch 
During 
phosphorylated.  The  enzyme  glucan  water  dikinase,  using 
ATP, catalyzes starch phosphorylation at the C-6 position, and 
phosphoglucan  water  dikinase  catalyzes  the  phosphorylation 
at C-3 (Haebel et al., 2008). Blennow et al. (2002) showed that 
the C-6-bound phosphate aligns well with the surface grooves 
of  the  double-helix  and  has  a  milder  effect  on  helix  packing 
than the C-3-bound phosphate. 
Phosphorus  content  in  the  potato  starches  ranged  from  420 
to 750 mg Kg-1 (Table 2). The range of the phosphorus content 
was  similar 
researchers 
(Wiesenborn et al., 1994; Noda et al., 2004; Noda et al., 2006). 
Calcium and magnesium contents ranged from 40 to 135 mg 
Kg-1  and  30  to  70  mg  Kg-1,  respectively  (Table  2).  Potassium 
content was high (485 to 875 mg Kg-1), as previously reported 
by  Noda  et  al.  (2014).  All  these  prior  studies  have  reported 
663  ppm  of  potassium,  113  ppm  of  sodium,  89  ppm  of 
magnesium, and 99 ppm of calcium in industrial potato starch.  
Starch  is  a  polysaccharide  containing  a  mixture  of  two 
biopolymers:  amylose,  a  linear  fraction;  and  amylopectin,  a 
highly  branched  fraction.  Amylose  and  amylopectin  contents 
affect  the  starch  granule  architectures,  pasting  properties, 
textural  attributes,  and  the  applications  for  processed  food. 
The  amylose  content  of  the  potato  starches  ranged  from 
28.51%  to  36.1%,  with  the  lowest  value  observed  in  starch 
from the Beacon Chipper cultivar (Table 2). 
Amylose content is an important characteristic for unmodified 
starches.  Amylose  is  characterized  by  high  structural  stability 
and ability to form films, which allows various industrial uses 
for high-amylose starches. Moreover, starches with high levels 
of amylose present low digestibility issues, thereby promoting 
health benefits (Hu et al., 2016).

factors,  such  as

The  amylose  content  values  are  consistent  with  those 
reported  by  several  researchers  (Wiesenborn  et  al.,  1994; 
Kaur et al., 2002; Singh and Kaur 2004; Kaur et al., 2007; Liu et 
al.,  2007;  Santos  et  al.,  2016).  The  difference  in  the  amylose 
content  among  starches  from  different  potato  cultivars  may 
be  due 
the  genotype, 
environmental  conditions,  and  cultural  practices  during 
cultivation.  
Starch  that  is  not  hydrolyzed  by  amylolytic  enzymes  in  the 
small 
intestine  for 
fermentation  is defined as resistant starch, and  its content is 
related to the rate of digestion by amylolytic enzymes. Several 
factors  contribute  to  this  process,  such  as  starch  source,  its 
composition,  amylose  and  amylopectin  ratios,  amylopectin 
chain  size  distribution,  phosphorus  content,  as  well  as 
processing  and  storage  conditions  (Shu  et  al.,  2007;  Noda  et 
al., 2008; Absar et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011).  
Data  analysis  showed  a  range  of  resistant  starch  content, 
10.91%  to  18.69%,  with  the  lowest  and  highest  contents 
observed  in  starches  from  BRS  Ana  cultivar  and  Harley 
Blackhell  cultivar,  respectively  (Table  3).  This  result  can  be 
related to the phosphorus content of the starches from these 
cultivars.  As  amylolytic  enzymes  are  incapable  of  bypassing 
the  phosphorylated  glucosyl  residue,  it  is  likely  that  high 
phosphorus  content  in  starch  might  reduce  the  enzymatic 
digestibility of raw starch (Noda et al., 2008). 
The mineral composition of starches may be decisive for their 
industrial  applicability,  as  the  degree  of  phosphorylation 
determines  the  starch’s  physicochemical  properties  and  is, 
therefore, relevant for its industrial use (Blennow et al., 2002; 
Singh et al., 2003; Karim et al., 2007; Carpenter et al., 2012). 
In addition, the level of divalent cations, such as calcium and 
magnesium,  appear  to  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the 
pasting  properties  of  starch,  presumably  by  ionically  cross-
linking  starch  phosphate  esters  (Zaidul  et  al.,  2007;  Noda  et 
al., 2014; Noda et al., 2015).  
 
Pasting properties 
 
important 
Pasting  and  thermal  stability  are  the  most 
functional  aspects  of  starch.  The  pasting  properties  of  the 
potato starches tested here are presented in Table 3.  
The  pasting  temperatures  of  isolated  starch  ranged  from 
66.33°C (Beacon Chipper cultivar) to 69.95°C (Marlen cultivar). 
Chung  et  al.  (2014)  previously  analyzed  the  characteristics  of 
starches  from  different  potato  cultivars  grown  in  different 
locations 
the  pasting 
temperature of isolated starch ranged from 62.2 °C to 65.8°C, 
which are lower than those observed in our study. This could 
be  due  to  the  amylose  content  of  the  analyzed  starches,  as 
high  amounts  of  amylose  cause  delayed  starch  swelling, 
thereby increasing the pasting temperature. 
Upon measuring the temperature and time taken to reach the 
melting  point  of  the  crystals,  we  observed  that  the  starches 
from  the  Marcy,  Beacon  Chipper,  and  Snowden  cultivars 
showed 
granular 
that 
organization,  easy  cooking,  and  production  of  weak  gels, 
which  may  be  of  interest  for  industrial  applications,  for 
example, in instant foods. 
The analyzed potato starches showed a marked peak viscosity 
ranging  from  771.21  to  1209.22  RVU  (Table  3).  The  starch 
from the BRS Ana cultivar had the lowest peak viscosity, which 
may  be  related  to  its  low  phosphorus  and  high  amylose 
content.  
Lu  et  al.  (2011)  report  that  starches  with  high  phosphorus 
content  tend  to  exhibit  high  viscosity  peaks  and 
low 
breakdowns, but an increase in phosphorus content does not 

in  Canada  and 

indicate  weak 

characteristics 

reported 

that 

produce  a  significant  impact  on  the  setback.  Phosphorus, 
when covalently bound to the starch granule, because of their 
ionic  organization,  can  assist  in  the  incorporation  of  water 
molecules,  and  thereby  alter  the  functional  properties  of 
starch. The amorphous fraction of the starch granules consists 
mainly  of  amylose; 
therefore,  several  physicochemical 
properties of starch can be changed by varying the content of 
this polymer (Mesquita et al., 2016). 
Starches  from  the  Beacon  Chipper  and  Marcy  cultivars 
presented  high  peak  viscosity  but  showed  low  resistance  to 
heating and agitation, that is, high breakdown (Table 3). Peak 
viscosity  demonstrates  the  ability  of  the  starch  granules  to 
swell  during  heating.  Starches  with  high  peak  viscosity  have 
low resistance to heat and agitation and exhibit high breakage 
of  viscosity  during  cooking  (Singh  et  al.,  2008).  It  must  be 
noted  that  calcium  may  have  a  possible  effect  on  these 
properties. Noda et al. (2015) reported that starches with high 
calcium  content  exhibit  low  peak  viscosity  and  breakdown, 
and  a  decreased  swelling  ability.  We  observed  similar  results 
in the starch from the Beacon Chipper cultivar, which had the 
lowest  calcium  content  and  highest  peak  viscosity  and 
breakdown. 
Final  viscosity  is  an  important  parameter  in  the  definition  of 
potential  applications  of  unmodified  potato  starches.  For 
example, in food products such as dehydrated soups, starches 
with  low  final  viscosity  are  desirable;  on  the  other  hand,  a 
high final viscosity is desirable in products  such as frozen pie 
fillings. Our analysis showed a final viscosity variation ranging 
from 322 to 448.1 RVU for the analyzed potato starches (Table 
3), with the highest value observed in the starch from the BRS 
Ana  cultivar,  potentially,  due  to  its  low  phosphorus  content 
(Table 2). 
 
Thermal properties 
 
The  molecular  disorder  in  starch  during  heating  in  the 
presence  of  water  promotes  the  decomposition  of  the 
crystalline  region;  this  molecular  disorder  can  be  analyzed 
through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Leonel  et al., 
2016). 
The  gelatinization  temperatures  [onset  (To),  peak  (Tp),  and 
conclusion  (Tc)]  and  the  enthalpy  of  gelatinization  (ΔH)  of 
potato  starches  are  shown  in  Table  4.  To,  Tp,  and  Tc  ranged 
from  63.42°C  to  65.88°C,  66.38°C  to  68.85°C,  and  70.27°C  to 
73.56°C, respectively. 
The  gelatinization  temperatures  (∆T)  of  the  potato  starches 
ranged  from  6.85°C  to  8.12ºC.  The  enthalpy  of  gelatinization 
ranged  from  14.59  to  17.81  J  g-1  (Table  4).  ∆T  indicates  the 
degree  of  heterogeneity  of  the  crystals  within  the  granules. 
The gelatinization temperatures (initial and peak) can be used 
as  a  measure  of  stability  or  completeness  of  the  crystalline 
regions.  ∆H  reflects  the  number  of  double  helices  that  are 
broken  during  the  gelatinization  process  (Mesquita  et  al., 
2016).  Thus,  starch  from  the  Colorado  cultivar  showed  the 
lowest  homogeneity  of  crystalline  area  amongst  all  analyzed 
cultivars. 
The  behavior  of  gelatinized  starches  during  cooling  and 
storage is of great interest to food scientists and technologists 
as it profoundly affects quality, acceptability, and shelf-life of 
starch-containing foods (Karim et al., 2000).  
During cold storage, gelatinized starch undergoes a process of 
molecular  re-association,  resulting  in  the  formation  of  an 
ordered  structure:  a  process  called  retrogradation.  The 
thermal transition temperatures and enthalpy of retrograded 
potato  starch  from  DSC  thermograms  are  presented  in  Table 
4. 

 

1788 

The  onset  temperatures  of  the  starches  in  retrogradation 
ranged from 48.90ºC to 50.53ºC. Peak temperatures  differed 
between  the  cultivars,  ranging  from  54.78ºC  to  58.87ºC.  The 
final  temperatures  ranged  from  62.90ºC  to  69.37ºC.  The 
enthalpy  of  the  retrograde  starch  ranged  between  4.85  and 
6.37  J  g-1  (Table  6).  These  results  were  similar  to  those 
reported 
in  other  studies  with  starches  obtained  from 
different potato cultivars (Lu et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2014). 
The  retrogradation  percentages  ranged  from  28.46ºC  to 
39.83%,  with  the  highest  value  being  observed  in  the  starch 
from the Colorado cultivar (Table 4).  
 
Pearson correlation 
 
A  correlation  analysis  for  potato  starch  characteristics, 
independent  of  the  cultivar,  showed  that  minerals  are 
correlated to important characteristics (Table 5). 
Phosphorus,  potassium,  and  magnesium  had  positive 
correlations  with  each  other  and  with  the  resistant  starch 
content,  peak  viscosity,  breakdown,  and  enthalpy  of 
gelatinization.  These  same  minerals  also  had  a  negative 
correlation with the final viscosity. Potassium further showed 
a positive correlation with the retrogradation tendency and a 
negative  correlation  with  amylose,  variation  of  gelatinization 
temperatures  (∆T),  and  percentage  of  retrogradation  (%  R). 
The  positive  correlation  between  phosphorus  and  peak 
viscosity, breakdown, and enthalpy of gelatinization has been 
previously  reported  in  other  studies  (Yoneya  et  al.,  2003; 
Karim et al., 2007).  
Calcium,  which  negatively  correlated  with  potassium,  had  a 
positive correlation with amylose, gelatinization temperatures 
(To, Tp, and Tf), and percentage of retrogradation (% R). Noda 
et  al.  (2014),  had  observed  in  the  thermal  properties  of 
control-  and  modified-  starches  that  To  and  Tp  were  slightly 
but significantly higher in the calcium- and in the magnesium- 
fortified  starches  (this  study  focused  on  the  preparation  of 
potato  starches  fortified  in  calcium  and  magnesium).  As  a 
divalent  cation,  we  expected  magnesium 
levels  to  be 
correlated  to  the  starch  characteristics,  similar  to  calcium; 
however, this was not observed in our study. 
Some authors report that the levels of cations tend to be high 
in potato starches with high phosphorus content and that the 
presence  of  these  cations  strongly  affects  the  rheological 
properties of the starches (Kainuma et al., 1978; Wiesenborn 
et al., 1994; Chen et al., 2003; Noda et al., 2007; Zaidul et al., 
2007).  
Our results on correlations of minerals with pasting properties 
agree  with  those  observed  by  Zaidul  et  al.  (2007)  in  starches 
from  different  cultivars  of  potato.  They  showed  that  high 
levels of sodium and potassium resulted in high values of peak 
viscosity  and  setback.  In  contrast,  high  amounts  of  calcium 
and  magnesium  in  the  potato  starch  resulted  in  a  low  peak 
viscosity and high breakdown and setback. 
The correlation analysis of the amylose content with the other 
analyzed  characteristics  shows  that  amylose  content  was 
positively  correlated  with  the  final  viscosity  and  peak 
temperature  (Tp)  and  negatively  correlated  with  the  viscosity 
peak, breakdown, and enthalpy of gelatinization.  
Zaidul  et  al.  (2007)  showed  that  a  high  level  of  amylose 
resulted  in  a  low  peak  viscosity  and  breakdown  in  potato 
starches,  which  is  consistent  with  our  results.  On  the  other 
hand, Šimková et al. (2013) showed that the amylose content 
negatively  correlated  with  the  phosphorus  content  in  16 
cultivars  that  were  grown  in  the  Czech  Republic;  these 
findings were not supported by our study. 
The  results  of  the  Pearson  analysis  for  resistant  starch 
contents showed a positive correlation with levels of

phosphorus,  potassium,  and  magnesium,  as  well  as  with  the 
viscosity  peak,  breakdown,  and  enthalpy  of  gelatinization, 
providing evidence for the effect of phosphorus. In the potato 
starch, the phosphate groups are attached to C6 and C3 of the 
B  chains  of  amylopectin.  Thus,  phosphoryl-oligosaccharides 
are  released  instead  of  glucose,  as  amylolytic  enzymes  are 
incapable of hydrolyzing the phosphorylated glucosyl residue. 
This  could  explain  why  the  phosphorus  content  also  affects 
starch  digestibility  (Haebel  et  al.,  2008;  Lu  et  al.,  2012; 
Carpenter et al., 2012). 
Another  point  to  be  highlighted  is  the  negative  correlation 
between  the  amylose  content  and  the  percentage  of 
retrogradation,  suggesting  a  close  relationship  between 
phosphorus and amylose content on this parameter. 
It  is  reported  that,  among  the  potato  starches,  starches  with 
high  phosphorus  levels  show  higher  RS  content  than  those 
with medium phosphorus levels, in comparison to other tuber 
and  root  starches,  and  that  the  amylose  content  alone  in 
potato  starch  did  not  greatly  affect  digestibility  (Absar  et  al., 
2009). 
Analysis  of  pasting  and  thermal  properties  showed  positive 
correlations  between  peak  viscosity  and  viscosity  breakage; 
the 
and  enthalpy  of 
retrogradation 
gelatinization, and a negative correlation with final viscosity.  
Moreover,  the  enthalpy  of  gelatinization  had  a  positive 
correlation with mineral content (phosphorus, potassium, and 
magnesium)  and  the  percentage  of  retrogradation  of  the 
starches; a negative correlation with amylose, highlighting the 
to  starch 
close  relationship  between  minerals  bound 
molecules;  and  amylose  content  on  these  determining 
properties for the applicability of starches. 
Low  amylose  starches  require  high  energy  for  the  rupture  of 
the  double  helices  of  amylopectin,  which  is  reflected  by  the 
enthalpy of gelatinization. 
 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Cultivation of potatoes 
 
Seven  potato  cultivars  were  studied:  BRS  Ana,  Colorado, 
Marlen,  Snowden,  Harley  Blackhell,  Beacon  Chipper,  and 
Marcy. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the cultivars.  
The  cultivation  of  potato  cultivars  was  conducted  in  Pouso 
Alegre,  State  of  Minas  Gerais,  Brazil  (latitude  -22.2341, 
longitude  -45.9332,  22°14'3"S,  45°55'60"  W,  altitude  822m, 

humid  subtropical  climate  with  hot  humid  summer  and  mild 
winter).  The  soil  of  the  area  is  classified  as  Red-Yellow 
Dystrophic  Latosol.  The  experimental  design  was  a 
randomized  block  design  with  five  replicates  and  seven 
treatments,  represented  by  potato  cultivars.  Before  planting, 
fertilization  was  performed  using  NPK  (04-16-08)  300  kg  ha-
1and  applied  to  the  furrow.  After  30  days  of  planting, 
fertilization of the cover with ammonium sulfate (300 kg ha-1) 
was  carried  out.  Irrigation  was  performed  by  spraying  when 
necessary  and  interrupted  30  days  prior  to  the  harvest.  For 
preventive  control  of  pests  and  diseases,  application  of 
insecticides  was  carried  out  in  the  furrow  and  after  planting. 
Desiccation  was  done  95  DAP  (days  after  planting)  with  the 
herbicide  Diquat  (396  g  of  i.a.  ha-1),  and  the  harvest  was 
performed 114 DAP. 
 
Starch extraction  
 
After  harvesting  the  tubers,  the  extraction  of  the  starch  was 
performed  by  a  physical  method,  with  three  repetitions  per 
cultivar.  Peeled  tubers  were  disintegrated  in  an  industrial 
liquefier,  and  starch  extraction  was  performed  using  rotary 
sieves  with  different  aperture  sizes  (0.25  to  0.088mm).  The 
“starch milk” was purified in a centrifuge, and the pre-drying 
and  drying  steps  performed  using  a  vacuum  filter  and  flash 
dryer, respectively.  
 
Chemical composition 
 
The  starches  of  potato  cultivars  were  analyzed  to  assess 
moisture,  ash,  lipid,  protein  (calculated  from  the  nitrogen 
content  through  the  factor  6.25),  total  sugars,  and  starch 
content, according to the AOAC methodologies (AOAC, 2007). 
The  content  of  phosphorus,  potassium,  calcium,  and 
magnesium  was  analyzed  as  described  by  Malavolta  et  al. 
(1997). Samples of 250 mg were placed in digestion tubes, and 
7mL of a 6:1 (v/v) solution of HNO3 and HClO4was added. The 
tubes  were  placed  in  digestion  blocks  with  temperatures 
ranging from 50°C to 250°C until a clear extract was obtained. 
Subsequently,  samples  were  cooled,  and  the  volume  was 
adjusted to 25 mL with deionized water. 
The  phosphorus  content  was  determined  based  on  the 
formation of the yellow complex vanado-molybdo-phosphoric 
acid.  Four  milliliters  of  deionized  water  and  2  mL  of  the 
mixture ammonium metavanate 0.25% (w/v) and ammonium 
molybdate 5% (w/v) were added to a 1mL aliquot of extract.

After resting for 5 min, the absorbance was measured  at 420 
nm using a spectrophotometer (FEMTO 600S). 
For the quantification of potassium, calcium, and magnesium, 
0.2mL  aliquots  of  the  extract  were  added  to  19.8  mL  of 
lanthanum oxide 0.25% (w/v), and the content of potassium, 
calcium,  and  magnesium  was  analyzed  at  766.5,  422.7,  and 
285.2  nm, 
respectively,  using  an  atomic  absorption 
spectrophotometer (Analyst 800, Perkin Elmer-USA). 
The  amylose  content  of  the  starches  was  determined 
according  to  the  ISO-6674  method  (ISO,  1987).  The  amylose 
content  was  calculated  from  the  standard  curve  of  amylose, 
and the results were expressed as percentage of amylose. The 
resistant  starch  content  was  determined  by  the  method 
described by Goñi et al. (1996). 
 
Pasting properties 
 
Pasting properties of potato starches were determined using a 
Rapid  Visco  Analyzer  (Model  RVA  4,  Newport  Scientific  Pty. 
Ltd.,  Warriewood,  Australia),  using  starch  suspensions  (2.5  g 
of starch in 25 mL of water), corrected for the basis of 14% of 
moisture.  The  program  used  was  Standard  1.  Peak  viscosity 
(PV),  breakdown  (BD),  setback  (SB),  and  final  viscosity  (FV) 
were measured from the pasting curve using Thermocline for 
Windows  software  (Newport  Scientific  Pvt.,  Ltd.,  Australia) 
(Santos et al. 2016).  
 
Thermal properties 
 
Starch  samples  (2.0  mg,  dry  basis)  were  weighed 
into 
aluminum pans, mixed with deionized water (6 μL) and sealed. 
The  sealed  pans  were  kept  at  25ºC  for  2  h,  for  balance,  and 
heated at a rate of 10ºC min-1 from 25ºC to 100ºC. An empty 
aluminum  pan  was  used  as  reference.  After  running  the 
samples  in  a  differential  scanning  calorimeter  (DSC;  Pyris  1, 
Perkin Elmer, USA), they were refrigerated at 5ºC for 14 days 
and  analyzed  again  under  the  same  conditions  to  determine 
the 
retrograded  starches.  The 
instrument  was  calibrated  using  indium,  and  an  empty  pan 
was used as a reference. Onset (To), peak (Tp), and conclusion 
(Tc)  temperatures  and  enthalpy  (ΔH)  were  determined  from 
the  DSC  thermograms  using  the  Pyris  1  software  (Perkin 
Elmer, USA) (Santos et al. 2016). 
 
Data analysis 
 
All  samples  were  tested  in  triplicates,  in  each  analytical 
technique. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to conduct 
the statistical analysis of the results with SAS (Version 9.2 for 
Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA).  When 
Windows,  SAS 
appropriate, the difference among the means was determined 
using  Tukey's  multiple  comparisons.  Statistical  significance 
was  set  at  5%  level  of  probability.  Pearson  correlation 
coefficients  were  determined  to  evaluate  the  relationship 
between variables. 
 
Conclusion 
 
In  a  constantly  evolving  and  competitive  market,  a  major 
factor  that  differentiates  an  industry  involves  the  creation  of 
new  products  and/or  the  production  of  products  with 
improved characteristics. Thus, the search for native starches 
with  properties  that  meet  the  different  demands  of  the 
consumer  market  is  of  great  significance.  The  results  of  this 
study  show  that  the  starches  of  the  seven  potato  cultivars 
have  a  high  degree  of  purity,  with  different  characteristics 
regarding  the  content  of  minerals,  amylose,  and  resistant

starch,  and  thermal  and  pasting  properties.  Phosphorus, 
potassium, and magnesium contents are closely related to the 
higher viscosity peak, tendency to retrogradation, percentage 
of resistant starch, and enthalpy of gelatinization; calcium and 
amylose contents have an opposite effect on these properties. 
The  information  obtained  from  this  study  can  be  useful  for 
food-related industries in Brazil that use potato starch.
