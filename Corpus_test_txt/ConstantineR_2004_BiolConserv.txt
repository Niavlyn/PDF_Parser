Abstract

Over the last decade there has been considerable growth in marine mammal-watching tourism throughout the world. Due to the
species use of coastal habitats, bottlenose dolphins are most frequently exposed to dolphin-watching tourism. We conducted boat-
based focal follows of schools of bottlenose dolphins to determine the eﬀect of boats on dolphin behaviour. A CATMOD analysis
showed that behaviour diﬀered by boat number, in particular, resting behaviour decreased as boat number increased. Dolphins
rested less and engaged in more milling behaviour in the presence of permitted dolphin-watching boats compared to non-permitted
boats. An increase from 49 to 70 permitted trips per week and a change in their departure times resulted in a further decrease in
resting behaviour. Currently the eﬀects of boats, in particular permitted boats, on dolphin resting behaviour whilst they are in the
Bay of Islands, are substantial. In the light of these ﬁndings we suggest that current legislation in New Zealand is not aﬀording this
isolated population protection from disturbance.

1. Introduction

Marine

tourism is a rapidly growing industry
throughout the world (Miller, 1993). Potential beneﬁts
of nature-based tourism include the potential to change
people’s attitudes towards the environment (Orams,
1995) and generating considerable revenue for local
communities (Duﬀus and Dearden, 1993; Hoyt, 2001).
One of the greatest challenges of marine tourism is
protecting and conserving the habitat and wildlife whilst
managing the needs of tourists (Giannecchini, 1993).
There have been concerns over the impact of tourism on
cetaceans (Beach and Weinrich, 1989; Bejder et al.,
1999; Corkeron, 1995; Constantine, 2001) but the bur-
den of proof often is placed upon those trying to man-
age the whale-watching industry (which includes whales,
dolphins and porpoises) rather than those proﬁting
from it (Mangel et al., 1996; Yaﬀee, 1997).

Cetaceans are charismatic animals with a wide appeal
for many people. Their popularity has resulted in the
rapid growth of the whale-watching industry through-

out the world. The most recent estimate (Hoyt, 2001)
found that commercial whale-watching tours are avail-
able in at least 87 countries and territories, and the
industry is worth at least US$1 billion. Despite this
rapid growth, very little is known about the short- or
long-term eﬀects of tourism on cetacean behaviour.

Bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus and Tursiops
aduncus, are the species of small cetacean most likely to
be exposed to tourism (Samuels et al., 2003). Despite the
global distribution of the species, they are frequently
found in isolated populations that range along discrete
areas of coastline (Shane et al., 1986; Wells et al., 1987;
Wilson et al., 1999; Connor et al., 2000). Because they
are long-lived mammals (40–50 years; Connor et al.,
2000), populations that include individuals with limited
home-ranges can regularly be exposed to tourism.
Research on mammals exposed to tourism has shown
that they usually become habituated to, or tolerant of
benign human presence, e.g., chimpanzees, Pan troglo-
(Johns, 1996) and grey whales, Eschrichtius
dytes,
robustus, (Jones and Swartz, 1984). If animals perceive a
situation to be threatening, however, then they are more
likely to become sensitised to human presence, e.g.,
bottlenose dolphins (Irvine et al., 1981; Constantine,

300

2001) and gorillas, Gorilla gorilla beringei
(Fossey,
1972). Killer whales exposed to experimental approa-
ches by a research boat have been observed using
avoidance tactics similar to those observed when prey
are escaping a predator (Williams et al., 2002). Mother-
calf pairs of bottlenose dolphins increase their dive
duration in the presence of boats suggesting some form
of avoidance behaviour (Nowacek, 1999).

An isolated population of 400–500 bottlenose dol-
phins, Tursiops truncatus, ranges along the northeastern
coast of New Zealand (Constantine, 2002). The nearest
coastal population of bottlenose dolphins is approxi-
mately 1000 km south (Bra¨ ger and Schneider, 1998) and
there is no evidence of interchange between these popu-
lations (Constantine, 2002). This population of free-
ranging, non-provisioned dolphins has been exposed to
dolphin-swim/watch tours in the Bay of Islands since
1991 (Constantine, 2002). Unlike most operations else-
where in the world, these tours operate under a permit-
ting system that restricts the number and frequency of
tour-boats operating and allows no more than three
boats of any type within 300 m of a school of dolphins.
Here we describe the eﬀect of boats on bottlenose dol-
phin behaviour. We examined the eﬀect of permitted
dolphin-watching boats compared to non-permitted
boats, and we quantify the change in dolphin behaviour
when further permits were issued allowing an increase
from 49 to 70 trips per week.

2. Methods

2.1. Field methods

(Constantine, 2002)

Non-systematic surveys were conducted in the Bay of
Islands, New Zealand, from an independent research
boat (a 4.7 m or 6.0 m boat powered by an outboard
engine), between December 1996 and February 2000.
There was an average of 1.2 schools (as deﬁned by
(median school
Connor et al., 1998) of dolphins
size=12)
in the Bay per day,
resulting in most boats encountering the same school on
any given day. The research boat was manoeuvred
carefully in order to minimise its potential eﬀects on the
dolphins’ behaviour. This involved driving the boat at a
speed that matched that of the focal school. If the
school was milling, stationary, or moving at slow speed
for a period of time then the boat was either placed in
neutral or the engine was turned oﬀ. If the dolphins
were travelling, they would often approach the boat and
bowride. On these occasions, both speed and course
remained consistent allowing the dolphins to determine
the length of time they would bowride, rather than the
boat being driven to either initiate or maintain contact.
Diﬀerences in the schools’ behavioural state resulted in
varying distances being maintained from the focal

school, but where possible, a distance of 50 m was
maintained. Even with these precautions, the presence
of the research boat was also considered as a potential
disturbance factor.

When a school of bottlenose dolphins was encoun-
tered, data on school size and age-class composition
were collected. A focal-follow observation was then
initiated and data on the number of boats within 300 m
of the school, the identity of those boats (i.e., permitted
dolphin-watching, non-permitted commercial or recrea-
tional boats), and the dolphins’ behavioural state were
collected. The dolphins’ behavioural state was deter-
mined by using a 2-min focal-school scan sampling
school
methodology and assigning a predominant
activity after an instantaneous scan of each individual in
the school (Altmann, 1974; Mann, 1999). A school
consisted of any number of dolphins moving in a similar
direction, engaged in similar behaviours and within ﬁve
body lengths of any other dolphin. The dolphins’ beha-
vioural states were assigned to one of eight categories
modeled on Shane et al. (1986). These were:

(i) Social. Dolphins observed leaping, chasing, and
engaged in body contact with each other.
Involved aspects of play and mating with other
dolphins. Might serve a social and/or sexual role.
(ii) Forage. Dolphins involved in any eﬀort to cap-
ture and consume prey as evidenced by chasing
ﬁsh on the surface, co-ordinated deep diving with
loud exhalations (but not chuﬃng), and rapid
circle swimming (but not chasing another dol-
phin). There was usually no contact between
individuals (as often observed when socialising).
Prey was sometimes observed in the dolphin’s
mouth and frequently observed during the fora-
ging bout.

(iii) Rest. Dolphins engaged in slow movements as a
tight group (i.e.,
less than one body length
between individuals). Movements during rest
were slower than those seen in slow travelling
behaviour (approximately one knot) and the
dolphins were occasionally stationary. Resting
lacked the active components of the other beha-
viours described.

(iv) Slow travel. Dolphins involved in persistent
directional movement at speeds less than three
knots.

(v) Slow travel—other. Dolphins involved in persis-
tent directional movement at speeds less than
three knots but were also engaged in equal
amounts of another behaviour (forage, social
and/or mill).

(vi) Travel. Dolphins involved in persistent direc-
tional movement at speeds of greater than three
knots but not involving porpoising, i.e., leaping
clear of the water.

(vii) Fast travel. Dolphins porpoising in a persistent,

directional movement.

(viii) Mill. Dolphins

showed frequent changes

in
heading that sometimes appeared as a transition
behaviour between other behavioural
states.
Milling was sometimes associated with foraging,
socialising or play.

Ambiguous states were infrequently observed and
were excluded from the data-set. A boat encounter was
initiated whenever a boat of any type came within 300 m
of the focal school with the intention of viewing the
dolphins. This distance was consistent with the New
Zealand Marine Mammals Protection Regulations (1992).

2.2. Analyses

2.2.1. Data-set

Behavioural sampling units consisted of focal-follows
where school size and composition remained unchan-
ged. Only follows where the duration of the encounter
exceeded 60 min were included. The two-minute sub-
samples collected during focal-follows were pooled
within each sampling unit to give a proportion of time
spent in each of the behavioural states (see Section 2.1).
During any given focal follow, the number of boats
present changed frequently so therefore, continuous
sequences of behaviour were necessarily fragmented for
analysis when placed into the appropriate boat number
category. This fragmentation reduced the degree of
autocorrelation to P= < 0.05 and minimised pseudo-
replication. Additionally, schools could not be used as the
sampling unit because the ﬁssion-fusion nature of dolphin
schools meant the composition of individual dolphins
within a school varied from day to day. The statistical
model used was the CATMOD procedure (SAS, 1996)
which compared the proportions of all behavioural
states for a variety of factors (see below for details of
speciﬁc models) using a maximum likelihood estimator
and incorporating a test of autocorrelation [AR(1)]. All
statistical tests used a signiﬁcance level of 40.05.

The number of boats encountering the dolphins was
recorded as 1, 2, 3, and 4+, where ‘1’ was the research
boat. The category of 4+ boats was in consideration of
the Marine Mammals Protection Regulations (1992),
which allows no more than three vessels within 300 m of
a school of dolphins. Dolphin school sizes were recor-
ded using four categories; 2–10, 11–20, 21–30, and 31–
50 dolphins. To avoid potential confounding factors
(Hurlbert, 1984) due to temporal changes
in the
dolphins’ habitat use (Constantine, 1995, 2002), each
season was analysed separately.

2.2.2. Number and type of boats

Changes in the dolphins’ behaviour due to the num-
ber of boats, type of boat (i.e., research, permitted, and

non-permitted boats), season, and school size were
tested using the CATMOD procedure (SAS, 1996).
From this model a Chi-squared approximation was used
to estimate the probability for each factor in the model.
The model
included an interaction term (school
size(cid:1)number of boats). A priori comparisons of
the research boat vs. all others were performed for all
seasons to determine whether observations when the
research boat was the only boat present were sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent to when other boats were present. A
priori comparisons were also performed for permitted
vs. non-permitted boats. Data collected when there was
a combination of permitted and non-permitted boats
were not included in the analysis.

2.2.3. Discrete vs staggered tours

During the research period there was an increase in
the number of permitted dolphin-watching tours and a
corresponding change in their departure times from
discrete departures (i.e., three boats leaving at 0800 and
1230 and one boat leaving at 1000) to staggered depar-
tures (i.e., two boats leaving at 0800, two at 0900, two at
1000, two at 1230, one at 1300, and one at 1330). The
eﬀect of the discrete vs. staggered departures on dolphin
behaviour for summer and autumn was tested using
CATMOD (SAS, 1996). Summer and autumn were the
only seasons with sample sizes that allowed statistical
analyses. The full model used in the analysis included
‘school size’ and ‘number of boats’ and the interaction
term.

3. Results

3.1. Sample size

Between December 1996 and February 2000, 261
hours were spent observing dolphins during 55 focal-
school follows. Only one school was followed per day.
The average focal-follow lasted 4 h 43 min (SE=13.79
min, range=1–7 h 45 min) and a total of 7595 2-min
scan samples were collected. Sample sizes for the four
categories were: 2–10 (n=17), 11–20
school-size
(n=20), 21–30 (n=8), and 31–50 (n=10). Dolphins
were accompanied by boats in addition to the research
boat in 58% of scans (n=4403).

3.2. Number of boats

Comparisons of dolphin behaviour in the presence of
the research boat vs. all other boats showed a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence for all seasons (Table 1). This suggests the
research boat could be considered as a suitable obser-
vation platform to contrast behaviour in the presence of
boats other than a carefully driven research boat. This
does not suggest that the research boat itself had no

302

impact (Nowacek et al., 2001) but that measured chan-
ges occurred over and above the eﬀect of the research
boat.

Dolphin behaviour varied signiﬁcantly with school
size and the number of boats present for all seasons
(Table 2). Examination of the predicted values for the
categorical responses showed the behavioural state most
aﬀected by boat number was resting (Fig. 1). The trend

Table 1
Analysis of contrasts of dolphin behaviour in the presence of the
research boat vs all other boats by season

was for resting behaviour to decrease with increasing
numbers of boats, especially for the commonly observed
schools of 2–10 and 11–20 dolphins. Resting behaviour
was most often observed in the presence of the research
boat (67.8% out of 837) and rarely observed when there
were more than three boats present (0.5% out of 837).
Milling behaviour generally increased in frequency with
increasing numbers of boats across all seasons. Milling
was most frequently observed whenever three or more
boats were present (46.4% out of 1088) and declined
when the research boat was the only boat present
(28.4% out of 1088).

3.4. Discrete vs staggered departures

The change in departure times, and increased number
of permitted dolphin-watching boats, resulted in a 54
min increase in the amount of time the dolphins were
accompanied by one or more permitted dolphin-watching
boats per survey (discrete— =98 min (cid:2) SE 10.4 min,
staggered— =152 min (cid:2) SE 11.3 min,
two-tailed
t49=3.529, P=0.0009). As expected, the number of
scans where there was one or more permitted operators
present also increased from 36.8% (n=1417) of scans
for discrete departures to 45.0% (n=1743) for staggered
departures.

There was a highly signiﬁcant diﬀerence in dolphin
behaviour between discrete vs. staggered departures in
summer (w2
7=70.80, P < 0.000) but not in autumn
(w2
7=11.51, P=0.118). Examination of the predicted
values showed the behavioural states most aﬀected by
boat number in summer were resting, milling, travelling,
and foraging.

4. Discussion

Few countries have legislation to protect cetaceans
from human disturbance. Whether the law in New
Zealand is eﬀective at protecting bottlenose dolphins
from disturbance by diﬀering numbers and types of
boats has not been described elsewhere. The present
study indicates that
this isolated
population of 400–500 bottlenose dolphins was aﬀected
interactions. This varied with season and
by boat
school size, but in all cases where there were signiﬁcant
diﬀerences,
resting
and milling behaviours,
in particular, were diﬀerent.
Dolphin behaviour was aﬀected by the number of
boats present and the type of boat. Their behaviour
was also aﬀected by an increase in the number of
permitted operators and a change in departure times,
but because these changes occurred simultaneously it is
not known whether one of these factors aﬀected the
dolphins’ behaviour more than the other or if there was
a cumulative eﬀect. Bottlenose dolphins were accom-
panied by between one and 20 boats, other than the
research boat, during the 260 h of focal-school obser-
vations (Constantine, 2002). In particular, the data
indicated the permitted boats had an impact above
other boat types.

Eleven percent of all behaviour observed during the
study was resting behaviour. This is similar to the 8–
10% reported for the bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of
California, Mexico (Ballance, 1992) and 11–12% repor-
ted for the Doubtful Sound, New Zealand population
(Schneider, 1999; Lusseau, 2003), but considerably
lower than the 2% reported for the population in the
Shannon Estuary, Ireland (Ingram, 2000) and 0.2%
reported for the population in the Sado Estuary, Por-
tugal (Harzen, 1998). The research sites in Ireland and
Portugal have strong tidal currents and appear to be
important areas for foraging and therefore probably do
not provide an ideal habitat for resting. This may
explain the lower rate of resting behaviour reported in
these areas. In the present study, resting was observed
during 69% of the scans when the research boat was the
only boat present. The amount of resting decreased sig-
niﬁcantly with an increase in the number of boats.
Resting was observed during only 0.5% of the observa-
tions when there were more than three boats associated
with a school. It appears that resting behaviour was
more likely to decrease for smaller schools of dolphins
(i.e., 2–20 dolphins) in the presence of boats than for
larger schools. With the majority (79.6% out of 201) of
schools
study containing
between 2 and 20 individuals, and the fact that there
was usually only a single school of bottlenose dolphins
in the Bay of Islands on any day (Constantine, 2002),
disturbance to resting behaviour is likely to have aﬀec-
ted the majority of schools.

encountered during the

304

A reduction in resting behaviour due to human dis-
turbance has been observed in other studies. Lusseau
(2003) found that the bottlenose dolphins in Fiordland,
New Zealand substantially decreased their resting and
socialising bouts in the presence of boats. He observed
only 1% resting behaviour in the presence of boats
other than the research boat, in contrast to 11% resting
behaviour when the research boat was the only boat
present. Duschene et al. (2000) found caribou (Rangifer
tarandus caribou) were more vigilant in the presence of
tourists and this resulted in a reduction of time spent
resting and foraging. In a study on Amur tigers (Pan-
thera tigris altaica), Kerley et al. (2002) found a decrease
in foraging eﬃciency by tigers when disturbed by
humans at kill sites. They suggested that tigers that were
able to remain at kill sites expended less energy than
those disturbed, and that this possibly resulted in an
increase in energetic demands because tigers forced to
eat less from each kill would spend more time hunting
and less time resting. Harp seal pups (Phoca groenlan-
dica) spent less time resting when disturbed by tourists
and their mothers spent more time vigilant and less time
suckling their pups in the presence of tourists (Kovacs
and Innes, 1990). Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) dis-
turbed by boats when hauled out rested less than
undisturbed seals, and there was an increase in seals
entering the water when disturbed and then being
reluctant to haul out again (Henry and Hammill, 2001).
Disturbance of howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) by
tourists often elicited a vocal response involving bouts
of roaring that was often followed by resting behaviour
when the disturbance ceased. Roaring also frequently
lead to inter-group conﬂict that increased the potential
for aggression and injury (Grossberg et al., 2003).
Whether the reduction in, or disturbance of, resting
behaviour discussed in these studies had an energetic,
reproductive or survival cost is unknown.

Resting is a fundamentally important behavioural
state to the health of many species of animal. Bishop
(1999) found that the heartbeat frequency that aﬀects
metabolic rate is considerably lower when birds and
mammals are resting than when they are active. The
eﬀects of a reduction in resting behaviour shown in the
present study are unknown but studies on birds and
other mammal species have demonstrated physiological
stress. Studies on free-ranging bighorn sheep (Macar-
thur et al., 1979)
found that energy expenditure
increased when they were exposed to human activity.
Tietje and Ruﬀ (1980) found that black bears (Ursus
americanus)
in
response to human approach and that this disturbance
resulted in greater overwinter weight loss than non-dis-
turbed bears. Fowler (1999) found Magellanic penguins
(Spheniscus magellanicus) that were unfamiliar or infre-
quently exposed to humans had higher stress levels than
penguins habituated to human presence. Adelie pen-

abandoned their dens

sometimes

guins (Pygoscelis adeliae) increased their heart rate
when disturbed by humans and helicopters and it was
found that disturbed birds had a lower breeding success
than undisturbed birds (Culik et al., 1990). A reduction
in rest is likely to result in a reduction of energy
reserves, which could aﬀect foraging eﬃciency, vigilance
levels, and the level of parental care.

The synchronization of behaviours such as resting and
foraging are thought to be important for group cohe-
sion and that groups beneﬁt through optimising care of
oﬀspring, anti-predator defence and increasing eﬃ-
ciency in exploiting food resources (Clark and Mangel,
1986; Emlen, 1991). It also can incur a cost to the indi-
vidual in a social group but is necessary for maintaining
social group cohesion (Conradt and Roper, 2000).

Synchronous behaviour is poorly understood in bot-
tlenose dolphins but a recent study in the Moray Firth,
Scotland showed that changes in synchronous surfacing
in the presence of boat traﬃc may be detrimental to the
population as it precludes them from engaging in other
behaviours, e.g., foraging (Hastie et al., 2003).

The permitted operators spent an average of 57.5
minutes interacting with dolphins (Constantine, 2002).
This was considerably more than the time spent with
dolphins by other types of boats (i.e., 6.8–9.3 min for
non-permitted boats, unpublished data). Because dol-
phin-watching boats usually operate in a manner diﬀer-
ent to other boats in order to maintain contact with the
dolphins,
similar prolonged encounters have been
reported elsewhere. Janik and Thompson (1996) found
the dolphin-watching boat in the Moray Firth, Scotland
accounted for 64% of all interactions observed, despite
a number of other boats using the area. Like the Bay of
Islands, the dolphin population of the Moray Firth have
been exposed to frequent boat traﬃc for many years,
but boats historically did not follow the dolphins (Janik
and Thompson, 1996). With permitted operators con-
tributing the major boat presence for the population of
dolphins in the present study (up to 70 trips per week),
the diﬀerence in boat manoeuvring and duration of
contact are likely to explain the dolphins’ behavioural
diﬀerences around the permitted boats. This ﬁnding
needs to be considered independently of the eﬀect of
other types of boat.

The issuing of further permits allowed an extra 21
dolphin-watching tours to be conducted per week by the
end of 1998. This change in permits provided an
opportunity to collect data on the implications of
increased dolphin-watching tours. The increased num-
ber of tours resulted in an increase in the amount of
time the focal school was accompanied by permitted
operators. It also caused an overlap between the tour-
boats. Subsequently, there was a further decrease in
resting behaviour when the operators changed from
discrete to staggered departures. The consistent response
of dolphins to the presence of permitted boats in the

R. Constantine et al. / Biological Conservation 117 (2004) 299–307

305

Bay of Islands over the research period suggests that this
population, despite frequent contact, have not habi-
tuated to these tours.

Research on other populations of dolphins exposed to
increased levels of boat traﬃc has indicated corres-
changes. Land-based studies
ponding behavioural
showed a decrease in aerial behaviours by spinner dol-
phins, Stenella longirostris, when boats were present
(Forest, 2001; Ross, 2001). Forest (2001) also reported
disruption to resting behaviours. Wells (1993) reported a
signiﬁcant increase in the number of bottlenose dolphins
that used deep-water channels when there were high
levels of boat traﬃc. These ﬁndings were supported by
Allen and Read (2000), who found a shift in habitat
preference in a population that had high levels of boat
disturbance on weekends, compared to a population in
a similar area but with no change in boat disturbance.
Changes in behaviour with increased levels of human
disturbance have been observed in other species of
mammal, e.g., humpback whales, Megaptera novaean-
gliae, (Corkeron, 1995), chimpanzees (Johns, 1996), ele-
phants, Loxodonta africana, (Andersen and Eltringham,
1997), and rhinoceros, Rhinoceros unicornis (Lott and
McCoy, 1995). Just like dolphin-watching boats, these
tours tried to approach the animals to observe them
closely. Chronic disturbance to populations can cause
behavioural changes, or even a population decline, that
may persist several years after the disturbance has
ceased [e.g., primates (Chapman et al., 2000) and
dolphins (Heckel et al., 2000)]. In some cases human
disturbance may cause animals to abandon or not use
ideal habitat thereby potentially increasing the risk of
mortality to their oﬀspring, e.g., southern fur seals
(Arctocephalus australis) (Stevens and Boness, 2003).

Currently the eﬀects of boats (in particular permitted
boats) on dolphin resting and milling behaviour in the
Bay of Islands, are substantial. We therefore conclude
that the implementation of the Marine Mammals Pro-
tection Act (1978) in the Bay of Islands is not aﬀording
the dolphins’ suﬃcient protection from disturbance. A
recent study found that over a period of ﬁve years, this
population became sensitised to swim attempts from
commercial
swim-with-dolphin boats and increased
their avoidance of swimmers (Constantine, 2001). It
may be that research on this population in the future
will show detrimental changes to this population’s use
of the Bay of Islands (as seen in Florida; Wells, 1993;
Allen and Read, 2000), or to their behaviour around the
permitted boats. The data reported here could be used
to implement precautionary management schemes that
take into account the potential long-term, cumulative
eﬀects of disturbance on this isolated population (Man-
gel et al., 1996; Yaﬀee, 1997). By restricting the number
of trips, trip duration, and reducing the amount of time
dolphins are exposed to tour-boats, these impacts would
be minimised.

The challenges associated with understanding changes
in the behaviour of complex social animals such as
bottlenose dolphins are compounded by the need to
produce eﬀective management reform within a short
time-frame. Ongoing evaluation of changes in popula-
tion size, range, and habitat use is vital. Because bottle-
nose dolphins are frequently exposed to tourism, and the
fact that this industry is growing rapidly, the need to
understand detrimental changes in their behaviour and
habitat use is important for understanding the eﬀects
of tourism on the long-term viability of the population.
During the present study permits were issued in ﬁve
other areas of this populations range. The eﬀects of
tourism on this population when outside the Bay
of Islands are currently unknown but the potential for a
cumulative eﬀect from human disturbance is of concern.
The Bay of Islands forms an important part of the
isolated study populations’ range, with a high resight
rate of individuals (Constantine, 2002). Consequently,
the dolphins are unlikely to suddenly discontinue use of
the area, even though they face increased human dis-
turbance. Many factors aﬀect animals’ habitat use deci-
sions, including proximity of equally high-quality sites,
relative risk of predation, and density of competitors
(Gill et al., 2001). In long-lived, slow-breeding species,
such as bottlenose dolphins, the long-term eﬀects of
reduced resting behaviour on ﬁtness, individual repro-
ductive success and hence, population size, could take
over 30 years to detect (Wilson et al., 1999, Thompson
et al., 2000).
