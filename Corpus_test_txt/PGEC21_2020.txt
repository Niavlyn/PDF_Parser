Between the 1st of February and the March 31, 2017, 793 stranded cetaceans were found
along the French Atlantic coasts. Common dolphins made up 84% of these strandings, and
most of these presented evidence of death in ﬁshing gear. The aim of this work is to test an
approach that could help identify the ﬁsheries potentially involved in a given stranding
event. To do this we examined how the distributions of likely areas of mortality of
bycaught dolphins, inferred from carcass drift modelling, coincide with ﬁshing effort
statistics of various ﬂeets, generated from the Vessel Monitoring System, in the area over
the same dates. Using reverse drift modelling, two main mortality areas were identiﬁed. A
total of 3690 common dolphins (IC95% [2230; 6900]) were estimated to have died in
ﬁshing gear within the Bay of Biscay during this unusual stranding event. There was a
positive correlation between the origin of stranded bycaught dolphins and the ﬁshing
effort distribution of French midwater pair trawlers, Spanish otter bottom trawlers and
French Danish seiners. This co-occurrence highlights a risk and identiﬁes ﬁsheries that
require further investigation (through observers or e-monitoring). These ﬁsheries differed
in their ﬁshing gear, but two characteristics appear to be shared: they targeted predatory
ﬁshes (sea bass and hake) in winter and used high vertical opening gear.

1. Introduction

The catch of non-target or non-commercial species in ﬁshing gear, deﬁned as bycatch, affects most marine species (Davies
et al., 2009; Hall, 1996; Reeves et al., 2013; Soykan et al., 2008). The impact of bycatch on marine mega-vertebrates can be

direct, such as additional mortality at unsustainable levels for populations, or indirect, including depletion of prey, habitat
destruction and disturbance of physical and chemical processes (Hall et al., 2000; Kumar and Deepthi, 2006; Read, 2008).
Bycatch is a potent threat for long-lived species with slow population growth rates, low fecundity or low survival to adulthood
such as seabirds, sharks, sea turtles and marine mammals (hereafter deﬁned as mega-vertebrates) (Hall et al., 2000; Lewison
et al., 2004a, b; Mannocci et al., 2012; Read, 2008). Uncertainties around the true magnitude of bycatch often delays man-
agement decision-making, and reducing bycatch remains a challenge for the effective conservation of mega-vertebrate
populations (Lewison et al., 2004a, b; Thompson et al., 2013; Lewison et al., 2014). Recent studies on the impact of ﬁsh-
eries on mega-vertebrate demography and population genetics revealed pessimistic conservation scenarios (Mannocci et al.,
2012; Mendez et al., 2010; Saavedra et al., 2018). Most types of ﬁshing vessels, including pelagic or bottom trawls, bottom-set
gillnets and longlines, contribute to this worldwide threat to large marine vertebrates (Gilman et al., 2005; Lewison et al.,
2004a, b; Lewison and Crowder, 2003; Read et al., 2006). Bycatch has been a major conservation issue since the 1970s and
although it is one of the most important man-induced threats to marine mega-vertebrates it still remains largely unresolved
(Breen et al., 2017; Cox et al., 2007; Cruz et al., 2018; Davies et al., 2009; Hamel et al., 2009).

Bycatch issues have long been ignored and under-documented, mostly because the occurrence of it is hard to monitor as it
takes place far from ports and ﬁsh markets (Hall et al., 2000). Fisheries management has focused for decades on commercial
species only, but a rising awareness of the detrimental effects of bycatch on species persistence and ecosystem functioning
has occurred due to charismatic species (marine mammals, sea turtles, etc.). Bycatch occurs far from the public eye and affects
species for which public concerns can quickly become salient, yet obtaining reliable estimates of its magnitude at a population
scale remains a difﬁcult endeavour (Read, 2008).

Mega-vertebrate bycatch is conventionally estimated through the stationing of on-board observers that sample a fraction
of the ﬁshing effort (Amand(cid:3)e et al., 2012). This approach has been considered successful in a number of cases (Beerkircher
et al., 2002). When vessels are too small to accommodate an additional crew member, this approach can be replaced by
port surveys that sometimes enable bycatch estimates (Goetz et al., 2015) or rapid bycatch assessments (Moore et al., 2010;
Poonian et al., 2008). However, even when the ﬂeet is composed of vessels that are large enough to accommodate observers, a
variety of factors can prevent the deployment of observers as designed in the sampling scheme, thereby precluding any
extrapolation to the ﬂeet (Benoît and Allard, 2009). In the case of the common dolphin in the eastern North Atlantic, the ICES
working group on bycatch in ﬁsheries (WGBYC) recently concluded that despite more than a decade of monitoring in several
EU countries it was impossible to conduct a bycatch risk assessment on this species (ICES, 2017a, page 4).

Stranding records are an important source of information on marine mega-vertebrates, and can provide critical infor-
mation with which to estimate a minimum level of bycatch across ﬁsheries (Adimey et al., 2014; Leeney et al., 2008; Lopez
et al., 2003; Silva and Sequeira, 2003). Several recent studies suggested relevant indicators of mega-vertebrate populations
based on strandings while accounting for drift conditions and observation pressure (Authier et al., 2014; Epperly et al., 1996;
Koch et al., 2013; Peltier and Ridoux, 2015). Stranding monitoring schemes can provide data on cetacean bycatch that are
complementary to more conventional approaches like on-board observer programmes, and in some circumstances observer
programmes and stranding scheme datasets could ground-truth each other (IWC, 2016).

In the northeast Atlantic, the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is one of the most abundant small ce-
taceans (Hammond et al., 2013; Laran et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2013), yet also one of the most vulnerable to bycatch by
ﬁsheries (Fern(cid:1)andez-Contreras et al., 2010; Leeney et al., 2008; N. de Boer, 2012; Peltier et al., 2016; Silva and Sequeira, 2003).
In the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, common dolphin bycatch is mostly reported in pelagic ﬁsheries targeting sea-
bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) or albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), but also in ﬁsheries using gillnets and trammel nets, as shown
by compulsory observer programmes conducted under regulation EC 812/2004. Very high estimations of bycaught common
dolphins have been reported in the past (Morizur et al., 1999; Rogan and Mackey, 2007; ICES, 2018). Observer programs have
estimated that up to 2000 common dolphins have died per year as a result of European ﬁsheries in the 90s and later again in
2009 (Murphy et al., 2013), while estimations using stranding data and reverse drift modelling over the period 1990e2009
suggested that as many as 3650 (IC95% [2250; 7000]) common dolphins were bycaught annually in the Bay of Biscay and
Celtic Sea (Peltier et al., 2016). For the year 2016, the estimated bycatch levels of short-beaked common dolphins in the ICES
subarea VIII of the Bay of Biscay ranged from 1607 to 4355 animals based on the observer programme, and from 1400 to 4800
based on stranding data (ICES, 2018, pages 61e62).

This situation has been at a standstill for decades. Very high levels of common dolphin strandings with bycatch evidences
were already being recorded along French Atlantic coasts in the 1990s, and since then 350 to 550 carcasses were recorded
annually (1997e2002, 2012e2014, 2016). Two unusual multiple stranding events occurred recently along the French Atlantic
coast, in February and March 2017, and most of the necropsied common dolphins were established as having been bycaught.
These events constituted a timely reminder of the importance of the bycatch issue for common dolphins in the eastern North
Atlantic. Understanding the ecological relationship between dolphins and ﬁshing activities is integral to conservation
management and decisions regarding bycatch reduction. Due to the difﬁculties involved in implementing the EC 812/2004
regulation that requires each Member State to design and implement a monitoring scheme for incidental catches of cetaceans
(ICES, 2017a; Peltier et al., 2016), the use of additional datasets to improve the understanding of the cetacean bycatch issue is
highly encouraged.

The aim of this work is to test an approach that could help to identify the ﬁsheries potentially involved in a given stranding
event. We tested this approach on the unusual stranding events observed in February and March 2017 along the French
Atlantic coasts. To do this we examined how the likely distributions of mortality areas (the locations where fatal incidents

were estimated to have occurred) of bycaught dolphins coincided with ﬁshing effort statistics in the area over the same dates
for different ﬂeets. The at-sea mortality areas of stranded common dolphins with bycatch evidence were predicted using
reverse drift modelling (Peltier et al., 2016; Peltier and Ridoux, 2015). Fishing effort data were generated from the Vessel
Monitoring System (VMS), which automatically collects positional data of ﬁshing vessels, and data on the types of ﬁshing gear
used and species targeted were attained from other ofﬁcial sources (Leblond et al., 2008). The mortality area and ﬁshing effort
datasets were analysed under a General Additive Model (GAM) framework to identify potential cetacean-ﬁshery interactions
in the Bay of Biscay.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. The stranding scheme

The French stranding network (Reseau National Echouage, RNE) is coordinated by Observatoire Pelagis. The network
currently includes over 400 trained volunteers distributed along the entire French coast that collect information on stranded
marine mammals according to a standardized protocol, including details of species, sex, measurements, external marks,
stranding date and location (Van Canneyt et al., 2015). Observation pressure has been stable since the late 1980’s. Cases where
death was caused by ﬁshing gear were identiﬁed by members of the volunteer network or Observatoire Pelagis, and these
cases were validated by Observatoire Pelagis following Kuiken (1994) and Bernaldo de Quir(cid:1)os et al. (2018). The major evidence
of lethal encounters with ﬁshing gear include: net marks; good nutritional condition; evidence of recent feeding; jaw and
rostrum fractures; froth in the airways; oedematous lungs; and dorsal ﬁn, pectoral ﬁn or tail ﬂuke amputations. Body con-
dition was established by evaluating the whole animal visually and measuring the thickness of the blubber layer. Froth,
hematoma and oedematous lungs can only occur ante-mortem and are related to asphyxia. Bleeding around fractures was
examined to conﬁrm ante-mortem trauma. Fin and ﬂuke amputations usually occur post-mortem as a result of disentangling
the bodies from ﬁshing gear. Bycatch was determined to have been the cause of death only among fresh and slightly
decomposed carcasses that had stranded between the Gironde and Loire estuaries (Fig. 1) (decomposition codes 1e3 (Table
1), as deﬁned in Van Canneyt et al. (2015), inspired by Geraci and Lounsbury (2005)). The presence of epidermis and intact
viscera in very fresh to slightly decomposed carcasses allowed the observers to carry out the full sampling protocol and
therefore establish the cause of death.

2.2. Estimating the mortality areas of stranded carcasses

The at-sea origins of animals that stranded during the unusual mortality events of FebruaryeMarch 2017 were determined
following the methodology described in Peltier and Ridoux (2015) and Peltier et al. (2016). The reverse trajectories of

bycaught animals were calculated from their stranding locations using the drift prediction model MOTHY (Mod(cid:3)ele Oc(cid:1)eanique
de Transport d’Hydrocarbures), which was developed by M(cid:1)et(cid:1)eoFrance to predict the drift trajectory of a ﬂoating object under
the inﬂuence of tides and wind (Daniel et al., 2002), and from this trajectory the likely area of mortality at sea was identiﬁed.
MOTHY includes atmospheric forcing from a global meteorological model. Carcass immersion was set at 90% in volume,
following previous in situ and modelling experiments (Peltier et al., 2012). The death-to-stranding time was determined for
each individual from visual criteria describing skin erosion (from Peltier et al., 2012). Experiments were carried out in winter
(January to March) in the Bay of Biscay to ensure compatibility with decomposition and drift conditions during winter
mortality events. Animals categorized as “fresh” were estimated to be < 5 days post-mortem and animals classiﬁed as “slightly
decomposed” were 5e15 days post-mortem. One location was retained for each day within the time window corresponding
to the decomposition code of each individual, and locations were weighted in order to obtain a total weight of 1 per drift. In
order to ensure a thin resolution and ease of reading, weighted ﬁxes of dead animal drifts were summed in a 0.4(cid:2) (cid:3) 0.4(cid:2) grid.
Four sub-sets of data were deﬁned according to stranding month and decomposition status: February - fresh animals;
February - slightly decomposed animals; March - fresh animals; and March - slightly decomposed animals.

To obtain spatially smoothed estimates of mortality we used a “block averaging” method (Petitgas et al., 2014). This
method allowed us to average the data by block over the 0.4(cid:2) (cid:3) 0.4(cid:2) grid, ranging from 43(cid:2)N to 47(cid:2)N, and from 1(cid:2)W to 4(cid:2)W.
The value in the ﬁrst block (block 0, origin ¼ x0) is the sum of the weighted locations encountered within its edges. The point
origin (x0) from block 0, in the lower left corner, was randomized 100 times. At each randomization k, the grid origin xk varies
and the sum of animals that died in each cell is calculated. Each block then has 100 sums associated with it. The mean of all
100 sums was then calculated and located at the centre of the block. This block-averaged data is similar to a kernel inter-
polation (Petitgas et al., 2014).

Analyses and cartography were performed using R software, version 3.4 (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996; R Core Team, 2017)

and bathymetric maps were plotted with the R library marmap (Pante and Simon-Bouhet, 2013).

2.3. Estimating mortality at sea

P. H(cid:1)el(cid:3)ene et al. / Global Ecology and Conservation 21 (2020) e00843

The observed number of stranded animals is a function of several parameters (Peltier et al., 2016):

The observed number of strandings was corrected using various parameters to estimate total mortality at sea. The dis-
covery rate was set to 1, since observation pressure has been stable since 1990 and since the public’s and authorities’
awareness (e.g. municipalities, prefecture, police, marine safety) during these events likely allowed for the detection and
reporting of all carcasses. Previous published work spatially corrected the stranding numbers using the probability of
stranding (itself a function of drift) in the area (Peltier et al., 2016, 2014; Peltier and Ridoux, 2015). We assumed that almost all
drifting cetacean carcasses were brought ashore by storms occurring days and hours before the unusual stranding events, so
the probability of stranding was conservatively set to 1. The buoyancy rate of dolphin carcasses (the proportion of all carcasses
that ﬂoat) was previously estimated at 17.9% [9.3%; 28.8%] in the North-East Atlantic (Peltier et al., 2016).

2.4. Fishing effort data

Fishing effort data were provided by the French Institute for Marine Research and Exploitation (Institut Français de
Recherche et d’Exploitation de la Mer - Ifremer) and the Directory of Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture (Direction des P^eches
Maritimes et de l’Aquaculture e DPMA - from the ministry in charge of agriculture and ﬁsheries), as agreed by the working
group on cetacean bycatch. Following the unusual stranding events of FebruaryeMarch 2017, the French ministry in charge of
the environment convened a meeting with the main stakeholders of the cetacean-ﬁsheries interaction network in order to
identify and resolve the issue of common dolphin bycatch in the Bay of Biscay. The working group is composed of repre-
sentatives from: 1) the DPMA, 2) the Directory of Water and Biodiversity (Direction de l’eau et de la Biodiversit(cid:1)e - DEB - Ministry
in charge of the environment), 3) Ifremer, 4) the industry from the Committee for Marine Fisheries and Fish Farming (Comit(cid:1)e
National des P^eches Maritimes et des Elevages Marins - CNPMEM), 5) the French Agency for Biodiversity (Agence Française pour
la Biodiversit(cid:1)e - AFB), 6) regional groupings of professional ﬁshermen (P^echeurs de Bretagne, OP Vend(cid:1)ee, P^echeurs d’Aquitaine),
7) Interregional Maritime Directions and 8) Observatoire Pelagis (University of La Rochelle and CNRS). The terms of reference
of the working group are (1) to improve knowledge of small cetacean bycatch in the Bay of Biscay, (2) to develop mitigation
strategies to prevent bycatch, and (3) to raise awareness among ﬁshers on the bycatch issue.

All European ﬁshing vessels over 12 m are required under EU regulation to be equipped with Vessel Monitoring System
(VMS) transmitters that provide information of their positions and activity. Data are gathered and archived by Ifremer and
administered by the DPMA.

Ifremer’s Fisheries Information System (SIH-Syst(cid:3)eme d’Informations Halieutiques, http://sih.ifremer.fr/) covers all ﬁsh-
eries operating in French waters and is part of Ifremer’s aim to build an operational and multidisciplinary monitoring
network, allowing a comprehensive view of ﬁshery systems including their biological, technical and economical components.
Available information includes VMS data, declarative landing statistics (log-books and sales provided by the ministry in
charge of ﬁsheries) and Ifremer survey data.

The VMS location data were converted into in ﬁshing effort on the basis of vessel speed by Ifremer (Leblond et al., 2008).
Raw positional data were collected at 1-h intervals. To estimate the speed of ﬁshing vessels, vessel displacement between two
successive points was assumed to have been rectilinear at a constant speed. Linear segments were mapped on a 0.05(cid:2) (cid:3) 0.05(cid:2)
grid. Mean speed was estimated from the time difference between each segment extremity. For each segment, the vessel was
considered to be in transit if the mean speed was >4.5 knots or if the segment was less than two nautical miles (NM) from a
ﬁshing harbour. The vessel was considered to be ﬁshing if the mean speed was <4.5 knots. The activity was unknown when
speed was 0 or when the time interval between two locations exceeded 6 h. Non-ﬁshing operations were removed from VMS
dataset. The daily sums of ﬁshing effort in hours were provided in a 0.05(cid:2) (cid:3) 0.05(cid:2) grid, and the information was split by ﬁshing
gear type, ﬂag, vessel length and registration harbour. Fishing effort during mortality events was aggregated within the
0.4(cid:2) (cid:3) 0.4(cid:2) grid (44.2(cid:2)N to 47.4(cid:2)N and (cid:4)0.8(cid:2)W to (cid:4)4(cid:2)W) used for aggregating carcass drift locations. The ﬁshing effort was
split according to ﬁshing gear type, following the blocking procedure described in section 2.2 (Petitgas et al., 2014) to ensure
spatial consistency between estimated densities of dolphin mortality areas and observed ﬁshing effort. Moran’s I statistics for
spatial autocorrelation was computed for each group of ﬁshery effort data.

Only trawls, nets and seines were considered as longline ﬁshing, pots and dredges are not suspected to generate small
cetacean bycatch in the Bay of Biscay. Ten ﬁsheries operating in the Bay of Biscay at the time under different ﬂags and
equipped with different gear types were considered (Table 2).

2.5. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs)

Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) were used to explore the spatial overlap between ﬁshing effort and the distribution
of estimated bycaught common dolphins at sea as obtained by carcass drift back-calculation. The densities of bycaught
dolphins, and ﬁshing effort in hours were logð1 þxÞ transformed.

In each cell of the study area, the density of bycaught dead dolphins was correlated to the ﬁshing effort of the ﬁsheries
operating in the area. Because of the exploratory nature of this work, a variable selection was not conducted: the primary aim
was to identify ﬁsheries positively correlated with common dolphin mortality.

Gaussian GAMs with an identity link were used to describe the relationships between the different ﬁshing gear types and
the mortality areas of bycaught common dolphins. The GAMs were ﬁtted using the mgcv library, version 1.8e23 (Wood, 2011),
using penalized thin-plate splines with basis dimension (k) set to 4 to prevent excessive wiggliness.

3. Results

3.1. Stranding events

Winter storms Kurt, Leiv and Marcel (February 3rd, 4th and 5th, 2017) and then Zeus (March 6th, 2017) generated west
(cid:4)1. These meteorological phenomena brought ashore all cetacean carcasses drifting in the Bay of
winds of up to 150 km h
Biscay, inducing two great stranding events along the Atlantic coasts. Between the February 1, 2017 and the 31st of March, 793
cetaceans were found stranded along the French Atlantic coasts (from western end of Brittany to the Spanish border). Two
main events were recorded: from February 3rd to 10th, and then from February 28th to March 14th (Fig. 1). During these
events, 573 small cetaceans were recorded from 44.2(cid:2)N to 47.4(cid:2)N (Fig. 2), 84% of which were common dolphins (n ¼ 483).
Most of them were examined by trained volunteers of the French stranding network (89%, n ¼ 431). Two thirds of these
examined common dolphins were fresh or slightly decomposed (69% n ¼ 297), and among these 95% presented evidence of
death by ﬁshing gear (n ¼ 281).

3.2. The mortality areas of stranded animals

According to the decomposition status of the carcasses, only locations corresponding to the death to stranding time (Table
3) were retained as likely mortality areas. Prior to the early February stranding event, all drift trajectories showed a large loop
pattern (Fig. 3). During the last days before stranding, the trajectories were fairly straight with a general WSW to ENE
orientation and were only altered by oscillations related to tidal currents. The trajectories of carcasses in the time leading up
to the early March stranding event had smaller loops which occurred during late February, followed by a general W to E drift
orientation in early March.

The likely at-sea origins of stranded common dolphins are represented separately according to carcass decomposition
status (fresh and slightly decomposed) and February or March events (Fig. 4). During the February stranding event, fresh
carcasses mostly originated from coastal areas, between the Gironde and Loire estuaries, while slightly decomposed carcasses
mostly originated from the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay. The common dolphins that stranded in March originated
mostly from the continental shelf, but the mortality areas of slightly decomposed dolphins were more widespread over the
continental shelf and slope and had lower densities than those of fresh carcasses.

3.3. Estimated total common dolphin mortality at sea

The total mortality of small cetaceans at sea from the tip of Brittany to the Spanish border between mid-January (i.e. 15
days prior to the onset of the February multiple stranding event) and early March 2017 was estimated at 4430 small cetaceans
(IC95% [2750; 8530]), including 3690 common dolphins (IC95% [2230; 6900]).

3.4. Spatial co-occurrence of at-sea origin of stranded dolphins and active ﬁsheries

The results of the GAMs revealed that the ﬁshing effort of six ﬁsheries correlated with the likely origin of bycaught
dolphins found stranded (Table 4). These ﬁsheries were the French, German and Spanish otter bottom trawlers (OTB_FR,
OTB_DEU, OTB_ESP respectively), the French otter twin trawlers (OTT_FR), the French midwater pair trawlers (PTM_FR) and
the French Danish seiners (SDN_FR). All ﬁsheries accounted for approx. 39% of the variance.

The spatial and temporal correlation between the origin of stranded bycaught dolphins and ﬁshing effort distribution
during the two stranding events was positive for French midwater pair trawlers, Spanish otter bottom trawlers and French
Danish seiners, but negative for French and German otter bottom trawlers and French otter twin trawlers (Fig. 5). Because of
limited data availability for German otter bottom trawlers, their relationship to the mortality areas of bycaught dolphins must
be considered with caution.

4. Discussion

4.1. General

The daily ﬁgures of common dolphin strandings reported during the unusual stranding events are up to 10 times higher
than the average numbers recorded so far in the same area and season (Dars et al., 2018). The total number reported for these
two months is about two to nine times greater than the yearly totals recorded in the last two decades (range 85e548; http://
www.observatoire-pelagis.cnrs.fr/les-donnees/(Dars et al., 2018)). However, unusual stranding events similar to this one have
been recorded before, although of lower intensity. The criterion used to qualify an unusual stranding event was a minimum of
30 common dolphins recovered over 10 consecutive days along a maximum distance of 200 km in the Bay of Biscay (Peltier
et al., 2014). It must be noted that bycatch mortality is not restricted to these events, it was estimated that 30e50% of stranded
common dolphins reported outside of unusual stranding events displayed bycatch marks.

Two general areas of origin were identiﬁed according to carcass decomposition state, used here as a proxy of time elapsed
between death and stranding: one coastal and one offshore. The coastal area stretches approximately from the coast to off the
100 m isobaths. The offshore area is mostly located from the 100 m isobaths to the continental slope. These limits have to be
considered with caution because the resolution of the grid is fairly coarse (0.4(cid:2) (cid:3) 0.4(cid:2)).

Multiple strandings occurred in the aftermath of winter storms Kurt, Leiv, Marcel and Zeus that hit the French Atlantic
coasts in early February and early March 2017. Although these storms were not a likely cause of mortality in common dol-
phins, they revealed the magnitude of bycatch-induced mortality by creating conditions that favoured the drifting of car-
casses from their at-sea mortality areas to the coast.

dolphins during February event (B; n ¼ 100); fresh dolphins during March event (C; n ¼ 53); slightly decomposed dolphins during March event (D; n ¼ 63).

During February and March 2017, some 4430 small cetaceans (CI95% [2750; 8530]) were estimated to have been bycaught;
which is of the same order of magnitude as the estimated average annual common dolphin mortality related to ﬁshing ac-
tivities between 1990 and 2009 (Peltier et al., 2016).

Mortality estimates were corrected using the buoyancy rate of dolphins, based on an in situ experiment (Peltier et al., 2016,
2012), which estimated the probability of a dolphin to ﬂoat (see section 2.3). This correction factor has a major effect on ﬁnal
estimates and could be updated by increasing the number of experimentally released carcasses and by reﬁning the estimates
of the proportion of ﬂoating carcasses. Two recent small-scale studies (n ¼ 17 in 2018; n ¼ 26 in 2019) with similar protocol in
coastal areas of Bay of Biscay in winter 2018 and 2019 highlighted both higher and lower recovery rates of dead dolphins
according years; the results of the 2018 study revealed a higher recovery rate and the 2019 study revealed a lower recovery
rate than the estimate in Peltier et al. (2016), which suggests that the buoyancy rate of dolphins can be variable.

The VMS data allowed for the distribution of ﬁshing effort to be considered in the analysis (Gerritsen and Lordan, 2011;
Hintzen et al., 2012; Kroodsma et al., 2018) in order to identify ﬁsheries with the highest level of risk to cetaceans. However,
the algorithms used to identify ﬁshing effort in hour analysed all ﬁshing vessel types similarly (e.g. trawls, seines, nets,
longlines). The interpretation of net ﬁshing effort has to be carefully considered. Moreover, false-positive results (where
vessels were travelling at ﬁshing speeds, but were not actually engaged in ﬁshing) cannot be detected, although it is unlikely
that this occurred often (Bertrand et al., 2008; Gerritsen and Lordan, 2011).

The European Commission (EU) decided to require automatic monitoring of ﬁshing vessels in 1997, which was imple-
mented aboard all ﬁshing vessels >24 m in overall length in 2000 (Commission Regulation (EC), 1997), >18 m in 2004
(Commission Regulation (EC), 2003), >15 m in 2005 and > 12 m in 2010 (Commission Regulation (EU), 2009). The resulting
VMS data therefore represent the ﬁshing effort only of larger vessels, which was only 27% of the French ﬁshing ﬂeet in 2016
(SIH-Syst(cid:3)eme d’Informations Halieutiques). Small scale and artisanal ﬁsheries have long been overlooked as well as recre-
ational and subsistence ﬁsheries, which can also jeopardize marine mammal populations (Cruz et al., 2018; Mangel et al.,
2010; Zappes et al., 2013).

The identiﬁcation of bycaught stranded dolphins allowed us to spatially correlate and overlap an impact indicator with
maps of a set of candidate pressures. The analysis of VMS data provided relevant information on the co-occurrence of

Three of the considered ﬁsheries were positively correlated with bycaught dolphin mortality areas: the French pelagic
trawl ﬁshery, the French Danish seine ﬁshery, and the Spanish bottom trawl ﬁshery. Three others were negatively correlated:
The French otter twin trawl ﬁshery and the French and German bottom trawl ﬁsheries. The negative relationships may have
been the result of a different spatial distribution of these ﬁsheries in the Bay of Biscay during these events. During the time of
mortality these three ﬁsheries were mostly operating in the middle of the continental shelf, while common dolphins were
estimated to be caught at locations more inshore and offshore (Annex 1).

4.2. Co-occurrence of European ﬁsheries and bycaught dolphins in the Bay of Biscay

The ﬁshing effort in the Bay of Biscay (ICES areas VIII a, b and d) is one of the most intense in the world (Kroodsma et al.,
2018) and includes the use of a large variety of ﬁshing gear and vessels operating under various ﬂags. Between February and
March of 2017 alone, up to 19 ﬁshing vessels from eight different countries were operating in the area. In the recent past,
French vessels from the Bay of Biscay landed over 200 species (Daur(cid:3)es et al., 2009). The diversity of ﬁsheries operating in this
area makes it difﬁcult to interpret the cetacean bycatch process as documented in stranding records; the present work is an
endeavour to disentangle the complexity of potential relationships between ﬁsheries and bycatch incidents.

The ﬁshing effort of French pelagic pair trawlers and French Danish seiners overlapped with bycaught common dolphin
mortality areas in shallow waters (50e100 m isobaths) from the Gironde to the Loire estuaries, while the overlap with
Spanish otter bottom trawlers was mainly located along the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay (Annex 2).

The seabass in the Bay of Biscay is mainly targeted by French vessels with more than 96% of international landings in 2016
(ICES, 2017b). The interaction between common dolphins and French pelagic pair trawlers in the Bay of Biscay has already
been documented. European Union funded projects including PETRACET (Pelagic TRAwl and CETaceans) and NECESSITY
estimated the annual ﬁshing effort among the main French, Irish, British, Danish and Dutch pelagic trawl ﬁsheries in the Celtic
Sea and Bay of Biscay (NECESSITY Report, 2008; Northridge et al., 2006). The PETRACET project revealed that most common
dolphin bycatch incidents were recorded aboard French pelagic pair trawlers targeting sea bass (Morizur et al., 1999;
Northridge et al., 2006). These ﬁsheries operate in winter when spawning ﬁsh aggregate (Fritsch et al., 2007; ICES, 2017b),
mostly in coastal areas between the Loire and Gironde estuaries (Morizur et al., 1999). The interaction between common
dolphins and pelagic trawlers is mainly driven by trophic relationships, as dolphins and sea bass target the same prey species
during sea bass spawning season (Spitz et al., 2013). Most bycatch incidents occurred at night, which is likely related to the
nychtemeral activity pattern of small pelagic ﬁshes hunted by the two top predators (Morizur et al., 1999). However, sea bass
only represented an average of 14% of pelagic pair trawler catches during the two 2017 mortality events (SIH-Syst(cid:3)eme
d’Informations Halieutiques).

The European hake Merlucius merlucius is the main demersal species supporting trawl ﬂeets in the Bay of Biscay and off the
Iberian Peninsula. Recently, Spain was estimated to land around 60% of commercial hake and France 30% (www.fao.org). High
levels of dolphin bycatch on French pelagic pair trawlers targeting hake were reported in the mid 1990s (ASCOBANS, 2015;
Murphy et al., 2013). Following a major drop in hake stock in the NE Atlantic, landings were almost halved between the mid
1990s and early 2000s (www.fao.org). Since mid-2010, hake stock recovery has led to increased catches (www.fao.org) and
allowed for a diversiﬁcation of target species for French pelagic pair trawlers in winter. European hake is now the most
abundant species (by weight) in landings recorded along the French Atlantic coasts (19% of total landed weight; Fishery
Information System/Ifremer). European hake was the primary species caught by French pelagic pair trawlers (48e81% of
catches) during the dolphin mortality events (SIH-Syst(cid:3)eme d’Informations Halieutiques).

Danish seiners were ﬁrst recorded to be operating in the Bay of Biscay in 2009 in the French ﬁshing ﬂeet (SIH-Syst(cid:3)eme
d’Informations Halieutiques, Leblond et al., 2008). Danish seiners are known to ﬁsh on demersal and pelagic species. Along
the French Atlantic coasts, Danish seiners landed 9% of the total sea bass weight, whereas pair trawlers landed 26% of the
seabass weight in 2017 (FranceAgriMer, 2018). In some harbours in 2017, Danish seiner sea bass landings were double that of
trawler landings, suggesting that this gear developed rapidly in the Bay of Biscay despite being fairly recently introduced.
During the 2017 dolphin mortality events, sea bass represented up to 11% of ﬁshes caught by French Danish seiners, whereas
hake constituted up to 25% of catches. The predominant species caught was the whiting (Merlangius merlangus) with between
8 and 31% of landings (SIH-Syst(cid:3)eme d’Informations Halieutiques). The main ﬁshing ground of Danish seiners in the Bay of
Biscay is located between the Loire and Gironde estuaries, mostly between the 50- and 100-m isobaths (SIH-Syst(cid:3)eme d’In-
formations Halieutiques, Annex 1). Depending on vessel characteristics and target species, the vertical opening of the seine
can reach several meters. The high vertical opening of Danish seines and their use to target seabass and hake in winter suggest
that this new gear might be similar to pair trawls in terms of common dolphin bycatch risk.

Spanish ﬁsheries in the Bay of Biscay are among the most prominent ﬁsheries in the European ﬁshing industry. In the 2011/
2012 ﬁshing season, Spain landed 20% of the catch selling value in Europe; while France landed 11% (FranceAgriMer, 2014).
Spanish otter bottom trawlers mainly operate along the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay (see Annex 1). Bottom trawls are
not generally considered to generate high levels of cetacean bycatch, particularly when ﬁshing in deeper water close to the
continental slope. Nevertheless, the otter bottom trawl gear category includes several types of trawls, including High Vertical
Opening and Very High Vertical Opening trawls towed by single or paired vessels. This method of ﬁshing has increased in the
Bay of Biscay in recent years (ICES, 2017b). Because the trawl operates in contact with the seabed, the gear is classiﬁed as otter
bottom trawl, but the high opening of the trawl creates a risk of cetacean bycatch, particularly when targeting European hake.

12

P. H(cid:1)el(cid:3)ene et al. / Global Ecology and Conservation 21 (2020) e00843

Some ﬁsheries known for having high bycatch levels were not identiﬁed in the analyses, mostly because their ﬁshing
effort, albeit signiﬁcant, was widely distributed (Lewison et al., 2004a, b). This was the case mainly for set gillnets and
trammel nets landing hake (96.7% of set gillnet landings during these events) and seabass (up to 19% of landings for trammel
nets during these events) (SIH-Syst(cid:3)eme d’Informations Halieutiques). Adult European hake feed on small pelagic ﬁsh and
therefore share, at least partially, the same trophic niche as seabass and common dolphin (Hubans et al., 2017).

4.3. A co-operative approach to ﬁsheries management and cetacean conservation

The present work was based on a joint analysis of two independently acquired datasets, cetacean stranding data and
ﬁshing effort from VMS data. This was only made possible by the collaborative spirit that developed within the newly created
working group on cetacean bycatch initiated by the French Ministry in charge of the environment. The analysis of co-
occurrence allowed us to assess how dolphin mortality areas, determined by calculating the drift trajectory of dolphin car-
casses prior to stranding, could help identify the ﬁsheries potentially involved in bycatch incidents. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst time that this approach has been attempted. The approach is promising because it provides a new way to investigate
bycatch incidents and better understand the interactions between dolphins and ﬁsheries. More developments and tests are
needed before one can fully delineate the role that this approach could have compared to more conventional methodologies,
including on-board observer schemes. Still, this is a major step forward that identiﬁed several ﬁsheries for which intensive
monitoring programmes, through observers or e-monitoring, and precautionary mitigation actions can be implemented. This
work stemmed from a bycatch working group constituted of all the main stakeholders involved in the Bay of Biscay bycatch
issue at national level. It is a step toward a shared diagnosis of the situation combining the efforts of scientists and working
group stakeholders, a collaboration which is crucial to the move toward acceptable mitigation decisions.

5. Conclusion

This work described and tested a new method of identifying ﬁsheries involved in dolphin bycatch using cetacean stranding
records and commercial ﬁshing effort statistics during one of the most intense stranding events ever recorded along the French
Atlantic Coasts. Vessel Monitoring System data was used to analyse the spatiotemporal correlation of ﬁshing effort and the likely
mortality areas of stranded common dolphins. The ﬁsheries identiﬁed as having spatial and temporal correlation with the
dolphin mortality events included vessels which varied in gear type and target species. However, two characteristics appeared to
be shared: the targeting of predatory ﬁshes (sea bass and hake) in winter and the use of high vertical opening gear.

In order to reﬁne our understanding of the interactions of cetaceans with ﬁsheries and to more accurately identify the
segments of the ﬂeets that pose the greatest bycatch threat, landed species related to ﬁshing effort should be incorporated
into analyses, particularly for the three ﬁsheries positively correlated with bycaught cetaceans and ﬁsheries known for high
cetacean bycatch levels.

One must also keep in mind that the present work, designed as a proof of concept, only dealt with a particular and unusual
mortality and stranding event and its conclusions are not directly applicable to all bycatch cases in the Bay of Biscay. The
bycatch incidents associated with unusual stranding events recorded in the Bay of Biscay since the late 1980’s could likely
differ greatly in their mechanism to the background bycatches that are continuously revealed in the stranding records.
