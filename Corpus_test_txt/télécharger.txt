Abstract
The objective of this study was to determine the storage efficiency and reconditioning of potato cv. Innovator for processing. 
Tubers were stored at 6, 7 and 8 °C in the dark for 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days and reconditioned at 15 °C for 15 days. TRS and 
RS were reduced as storage temperature increased from 6 + 15 °C to 8 + 15 °C. Regardless of temperature and storage time, sugar 
contents were suitable for industry; however non-enzymatic browning remained in category 2 for up to 60, 90 and 150 days in 
tubers stored at 6 + 15 °C, 7 + 15 °C and 8 + 15 °C, respectively. Starch was influenced by storage time, despite the absence of 
temperature effect. Regardless of the temperature, sprouting started at 90 days, but the growth of shoots was directly proportional 
to the increase in temperature. The PPO and POD increased at the beginning of storage but did not cause darkening before the 
frying. Reduction in storage temperature followed by reconditioning did not delay the onset of sprouting, but reduced the size 
of sprouts, maintained adequate sugar levels, however it promoted non-enzymatic browning.

Keywords: sprout; reducing sugars; reconditioning.

Practical Application: Determination of temperature and ideal storage time for potato cv. Innovator.

1 Introduction

Potato  plays  an  important  role  in  the  world  economy 
because is one of the most consumed staple food in the diet of 
many countries. The processed potato market is on the rise due 
to changes in the population’s eating habits, who seek products 
that  are  easy  to  be  prepared.  For  the  constant  supply  of  raw 
material for the industry, the prolonged refrigerated storage of 
the tubers is carried out.

Potato tubers are in general stored at 8 to 10 °C (Wiberley-Bradf
ord  et  al.,  2016).  The  objective  of  the  low  temperature  is  to 
reduce sprouting, loss of water and infection by microorganisms 
(Chen et al., 2012). However, within this temperature range, there 
is a high incidence of diseases and sprouting (Wiberley-Bradford 
et al., 2016). Therefore, storage is necessary at lower temperatures.

Nevertheless, when potato tubers are stored at temperatures below 
8 °C, they accumulate glucose and fructose (RS) (Wiberley-Bradf
ord et al., 2016) a physiological disorder called cold-induced 
sweetening (CIS). The carbonyl or ketone group from RS reacts 
with the amino group of the amino acids, mainly with asparagine, 
in a non-enzymatic reaction (Maillard reaction). This reaction 
results in formation of the melanoidin pigments during frying, 
causing the darkening of the fried products (Amy et al., 2016). 
In addition, other reactions occur during this process leading 
to the formation of acrylamide (Amy et al., 2016).

Acrylamide was classified as a likely carcinogenic substance 
to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(Pelucchi  et  al.,  2011)  and,  a  category  2  carcinogen  by  the 
European Union (Bethke & Bussan 2013). Studies suggest that 
55% of acrylamide consumed in a typical American diet may be

derived from potato products (Katz et al., 2012). In potato, there 
is a direct relationship between the reduction of sugar contents 
in raw tubers and the amount of produced acrylamide in fried 
products (Bethke & Bussan, 2013).

An alternative to reduce the accumulation of sugars would 
be the reconditioning at a higher temperature after the long term 
storage and before processing, in order to reverse the metabolism 
of carbohydrates. However, the effectiveness of reconditioning 
depends on the cultivar, temperature and duration of cold storage 
(Knowles et al., 2009).

In addition to the accumulation of sugars, low temperatures 
may increase the activity of oxidative enzymes peroxidase (POD) 
and  polyphenoloxidase  (PPO),  due  to  the  stress  condition, 
causing the darkening before frying.

The objective of this study was to determine the storage 
efficiency and reconditioning on potato cv. Innovator for processing

2 Materials and methods

Tubers of cv. Innovator potato cultivar were obtained from 
the commercial production area of   the region of Perdizes, Minas 
Gerais (19º 21’ 10” S, 47º 17’ 34” W and 1000 m). The tubers 
were  planted  in  May  and  hand-harvested  in  September  2017. 
The curing was performed at 15 °C for 15 days. The temperature 
was reduced daily by 1 °C until reaching storage temperatures. The  
tubers were stored at 6, 7 and 8 °C (90 ± 2% RH) in the absence 
of light for 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days, and after each period, 
they were reconditioned for 15 days at 15 °C. Analyzes of total

Pereira et al.

soluble sugars (TSS), reducing sugars (RS), non-reducing sugars 
(NRS), post-fry color, starch, sprouting onset, peroxidase activity 
(POD) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO) were performed in those 
periods. The end of storage was determined by sprouting of tubers.

2.1 Determination of TSS, RS and NRS

TSS and RS were extracted from 5 g of tuber flesh mass. 
Then, 80% ethanol was added at 100 °C, triturated and centrifuged 
three times for 10 min at 1500 g. At each centrifugation, the samples 
were filtered and the combined final volume of the filtrates was 
standardized (Dubois et al., 1956).

TSS  were  quantified  by  the  Phenol-sulfuric  method 
(Dubois et al., 1956), using sucrose as standard. The reaction 
was composed of 250 μL of the extract, 250 μL of 5% phenol and 
1.25 mL of sulfuric acid. Subsequently, the reaction was placed 
in water bath for 20 min at 30 °C. Reading was performed in 
a  spectrophotometer  (Genesys-  10UV,  scanning)  at  490  ŋm. 
The results were expressed in % of fresh weight.

RS  were  determined  by  the  dinitrosalicylic  acid  (DNS) 
methodology described by Gonçalves et al. (2010) with adaptations 
using  fructose  as  standard.  The  reaction  was  composed  of 
500 μL of DNS and 500 μL of the sample, subsequently placed 
in water at 100 °C and after 5 min, 4 mL of distilled water was 
added in it. The readings were performed in spectrophotometer 
(Genesys- 10UV, scanning) at 540 ŋm and expressed in percentage.

NRS were calculated by the difference between TSS and RS 

2.2 Determination of French fry color

To determination of French fry color, the tubers were cut 
into sticks using a manual cutter and fried in electric fryer, with 
capacity for 3 L (Model: Ford®) for 3 min at 180 °C. The color 
of the post-fry potatoes was visually determined based on the 
grading  scale  recommended  by  the  ‘United  States  Standards 
for  Grades  of  Frozen  French  Fried  Potatoes’  (United  States 
Department of Agriculture, 1967) and the fast food industry 
color grading chart from 1 to 5.

2.3 Determination of starch and Sprouting onset

With the residue from TSS and RS extraction, the starch content 
was determined by the methodology described by McCready et al. 
(1950), the result being multiplied by the factor 0.9, because during 
the formation of starch there is the removal of a water molecule.

Sprouting onset was determined from the visualization of 

sprouted tubers

2.4 Determination of POD and PPO

Enzymatic extracts of POD, PPO were obtained from 5 g of 
potato flesh was mixed with 15 mL of extraction buffer (0.1 M 
potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5). The material was ground, 
filtered on gauze and centrifuged at 17,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C 
(Lagrimini et al., 1997).

Enzymatic activity of POD was determined adding 100 μL 
of the enzyme extract to the reaction medium containing 0.5 mL of 
guaiacol (1.7%), 1.5 mL of 0.1 mol L-1 potassium phosphate buffer 
(pH 7.0) and 0.5 mL of hydrogen peroxide (1.8%). Reading was 
performed in a spectrophotometer at 470 μm for 3 min and the 
data expressed in units of absorbance (UA) min-1 mg-1 protein 
(Lagrimini et al., 1997).

Activity of PPO was determined in the reaction medium 
composed  by  100  μL  enzyme  extract,  1.5  mL  of  0.1  mol  L-1 
potassium  phosphate  buffer  (pH  7.0),  0.5  mL  catechol  and 
0.9 mL of distilled water. The reading was performed for 3 min 
at 420 μm and expressed in UA min-1 mg-1 protein (Kavrayan 
& Aydemir 2001).

Total protein was determined by the method of Bradford 

(1976) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard.

2.5 Statistical analysis

The experiment was conducted in split-plot design, where 
the plots were the temperatures (6, 7 and 8 °C + 15 °C) and 
in the subplots, the storage times (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days 
of storage + 15 days of reconditioning). It was used a completely 
randomized  design,  with  five  replications,  each  repetition 
consisting of two tubers. For the analysis of sugars, starch and 
enzymatic activity of POD and PPO were performed analysis 
of variance and regression unfolding, the R version 1.1.2 was 
used (Ferreira et al., 2013).

RS and TSS decreased with increasing storage temperature 
from 6 + 15 °C to 8 + 15 °C, from 0.06 to 0.02% and 0.19 to 0.15%, 
respectively (Figure 1). RS content being the most affected by 
the increase in storage temperature, as observed in the present 
study  (Figure  1).  While  NRS  was  not  influenced  by  storage 
temperature (Figure 1).

The storage time of the tubers altered the TSS, NRS and 
RS contents, which increased from 94.6; 30 and 104.5 days of 
storage with values of 0.17; 0.05; 0.12% at 150 days, respectively. 
(Figure 2).

The combination of storage (6, 7 and 8 °C) with subsequent 
reconditioning at 15 °C, even after 150 days of storage, kept the 
RS  content  below  industry  recommended  0.12%  fresh  mass 
(Stark et al., 2003).

Regardless of storage temperature, tubers were classified into 
category 2 at 30 and 60 days of storage (Figure 3). At 90 days of 
storage, tubers stored at 6 + 15 °C had a darker color, classification 
3, while those stored at 7 + 15 and 8 + 15 °C remained in category 
2, but the tips of the chips were darker. (Figure 3). At 120 days, 
the tubers at 6 + 15, 7 + 15 and 8 + 15 °C were classified into 
categories 3, 3 and 2, respectively (Figure 3). At 150 days, the 
tubers at 6 + 15 °C had a very dark color, classified in category 4, 
while at 7 + 15 and 8 + 15 °C at 3 and 2, respectively (Figure 3).

Although sugar contents remained adequate for processing, the 
coloring after frying was adequate only until 60, 90 and 150 days 
at temperatures of 6 + 15, 7 + 15 and 8 + 15 °C, respectively. 

and expressed in percentage of the fresh weight.

reaction (Maillard reaction) leading to the formation of melanoid 
pigments (Amy et al., 2016). However, sugars are not the only 
factors  that  affect  the  color  of  the  sticks,  but  are  also  related 
to  the  concentration  of  amino  acids  and  total  polyphenols 
(Freitas et al., 2012).

Abong et al. (2009), by testing eight commercial cultivars and 
three commercial clones in Kenyan, found that reconditioning 
for  three  weeks  at  15  °C  after  being  stored  at  4  °C  for  three 
months did not effectively reduce browning after frying. All the 
potatoes were dark brown in color and unpleasant in taste, being 
classified as unacceptable by the industry. Indicating that the 
positive response to reconditioning is dependent on temperature 
(Kumar et al., 2004) and storage time (Knowles et al., 2009). 
Thus, in order to extend the acceptance period for toothpicks to 
the industry, higher temperature and reconditioning time can be 
used, reducing amino acid concentration and plifenol content. 
In addition to the storage conditions the positive response is 
influenced by the cultivar used, study with ‘Diamond’, ‘Hermes’, 
‘Lady Rosetta’ and ‘Spunta’ stored at 4 or 5 °C for 30, 60, 120 
and 150 days followed by Rebuild at 16 °C for 0, 15 and 30 days 
showed improvement in the terrors of AR, AST and coloration 
after  frying.  For  Hermes  cultivar,  15  days  of  reconditioning 
were sufficient, while for Lady Rosetta cultivar 30 days, while

Processing industries reject tubers in the above USDA 2 categories 
(Knowles  et  al.,  2009).  RS  promote  darkening  during  frying 
because their carbonyl or ketone group reacts with the amino

Pereira et al.

‘Diamond’  and  ‘Spunta’  remained  below  standard  in  these 
evaluated reconditioning periods (Kyriacou et al., 2009).

Starch contents were influenced by storage time increasing 
from 65.9 days, ranging from 19.3 to 21.9% at 30 and 150 days of 
storage, respectively (Figure 4), despite the absence of temperature 
effect. The potato chips industry requires tubers with starch content 
greater than 15% for good crispness (Kita, 2002). The cultivars 
Eliza, Pearl and Atlantic when stored at 2 °C for 10 days and 
reconditioned at 15 °C for 10 or 20 days, showed no changes 
in starch content (Chapper et al., 2004). Emphasizing that the 
effectiveness of reconditioning is dependent on the cultivar.

Regardless of temperature, sprouting began at 90 days of 
storage (Figure 5), correlating with increasing TSS (Figure 2) and 
darkening during frying (Figure 3). During sprouting, tubers 
require more sugars to act as a respiratory substrate for sprout 
growth and development (Bisognin et al., 2008). The increase 
in  storage  temperature  was  directly  proportional  to  the  size 
of  the  sprouts,  making  the  tubers  physically  unsuitable  for 
toothpick processing (Figure 5). Storage at 6 °C with subsequent 
reconditioning at 15 °C slowed the size of the sprouts, becoming 
smaller at 150 days compared to 8 + 15 °C, in which the size 
of  the  sprouts  made  tubers  physically  unsuitable  for  stick 
potato processing. (Figure 5), the effects of temperature on the 
physiological aging of tubers are already known, and temperature 
reduction  is  one  of  the  best  ways  to  retard  the  physiological 
aging of tubers (Muthoni et al., 2014).

The enzymatic activity of PPO and POD was not influenced 
by storage temperature followed by reconditioning, but had the 
effect of storage time, where PPO and POD increased to 100.6 and 
86.9 days, with a maximum activity of 49.36. and 7.28 min-1 mg-1 
protein  respectively  (Figure  6).  The  increase  in  enzymatic 
activity is due to the stress condition caused by exposure to low 
temperatures in which the tubers were subjected. Under stress 
conditions, reactive oxygen species are formed to prevent cellular 
damage  by  activating  enzymatic  and  non-enzymatic  defense 
systems, such as POD and PPO activity. Both PPO and can lead to 
darkening before frying, PODs use H2O2 as oxidant and phenolic 
compounds as electron donors (Barbosa et al., 2014) leading to 
melanin formation. Despite the initial increase in oxidative enzyme 
activity, no browning was observed on the sticks before frying.

4 Conclusion

Reduction in storage temperature followed by reconditioning 
did not delay the onset of sprouting, but reduced the size of 
sprouts, maintained adequate sugar levels, however it promoted 
non-enzymatic browning.
