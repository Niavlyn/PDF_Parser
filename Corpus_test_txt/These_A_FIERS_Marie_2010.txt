Ma reconnaissance va également aux membres du comité de pilotage de cette thèse 
qui ont accepté de passer de longues heures à réfléchir, discuter et débattre sur les 
travaux  effectués  et  à  venir.  Safya  Menasseri,  Claire  Campion  et  Emile  Benizri  ont 
apporté leurs points de vue variés et ont participé à la richesse de ce travail. Merci 
 
Un  immense  merci  à  Catherine  Chatot,  pour  l'énergie  dépensée  sans  compter  à  la 
mise  en  place  et  à  l'exécution  de  ce  projet  et  pour  sa  disponibilité  malgré 
l'éloignement  (Dijon  –  Châteauneuf  du  Faou,  800  km,  c'était  pas  gagné).  Merci  de 
m'avoir  fait  découvrir  "le  monde  de  la  patate"  depuis  le  processus  de  création  de 
nouvelles variétés jusqu'au tri des pommes de terre par laser (impressionnant!), et de 
m'avoir permis de participer à de nombreux congrès en France et à l'étranger dans 
lesquels j'ai pu partager mon expérience de recherche. 
 
Merci à Yves Le Hingrat, pour le temps qu'il à consacré à ce projet, ses conseils et 
les informations précieuses que avons échangées. 
 
Je suis également reconnaissante à toutes les personnes de Germicopa et Bretagne 
Plants  qui  ont  participé  de  près  ou  de  loin  à  ce  travail:  Jean-Yves  Abgrall,  Gisèle 
Hemery,  Jean  Marhic,  Robert  Roudaut  et  Yvon  Pouliquen  et  les  producteurs  de 
pommes  de  terre  qui  m'ont  fourni  des  échantillons,  en  particulier  Jean  Marc 
Guillermic  qui  a  mis  une  de  ses  parcelles  à  ma  disposition  pour  effectuer  des 
prélèvements. 
 
Je voudrais aussi dire un grand merci à Karima Bouchek-Mechiche qui a toujours été 
présente  lorsque  je  lui  demandais  un  conseil  ou  un  service.  Je  me  souviens  de 
isoler  des

clique de l'INRA du Rheu.  
 
Je n'oublie pas non plus Sonia Hallier et Katie Craddock de BBV, qui travaillent sur la 
même problématique que moi et avec qui les échanges ont été fructueux. 
 
Ce  n'est  pas  sans  un  peu  d'émotion  que  je  remercie  les  personnes  de  l'INRA  de 
Dijon avec qui j'ai travaillé au quotidien. 
 
Christian Steinberg qui, malgré un emploi du temps impressionnant, a toujours été là 
quand  j'avais  besoin.  Merci  pour  les  discussions  mensuelles  où  les  cerveaux 
fumaient,  pour  les  idées  qui  fusent  dans  ta  tête  et  pour  ta  générosité.  Merci  aussi 
pour  les  petits  moments  de  détente  au  détour  d'un  couloir  où  tu  me  racontais  tes 
exploits sportifs… 
 
Véronique  Edel-Hermann,  Véro.  Elle  aussi  a  été  un  pilier  de  ce  travail.  Toujours 
partante  pour  se  triturer  les  méninges  et  trouver  de  nouvelles  idées  pour  faire 
avancer  le  schmilblick,  elle  a  fait  preuve  d'une  incroyable  méticulosité  quand  il 
s'agissait d'analyser des données ou de corriger les articles. Je veux te dire toute ma 
reconnaissance.  Merci  d'avoir  repris  toutes  mes  séquences  d'ITS et  merci  pour  ton 
acharnement  à  faire  "parler"  les  données  d'AFLP.  La  science  est  parfois  coriace, 
mais travailler avec toi a été un plaisir. 
 
Claude  Alabouvette  a  été  à  l'origine  de  la  venue  de  ce  projet  à  Dijon  et  je  l'en 
remercie.  Claude  appartient  à  une  espèce  de  chercheur  en  voie  de  disparition, 
phytopathologiste véritable à l'œil critique développé, d'une grande ouverture d'esprit 
et un brin rebelle. Tous les labos devraient avoir un Claude! 
 
Nadine Gautheron a été mon guide, dès le début quand j'ai débarqué un peu perdue 
au  milieu  du  laboratoire.  Elle  m'a  appris  toutes  les  techniques  et  les  habitudes  du 
labo. Merci pour le travail que tu as fait sur la T-RFLP. Je te dois une grosse partie 
du chapitre 4 de cette thèse. 
Merci  aussi,  Nad,  pour  les  apéros,  les  week-ends  au  ski,  tes  conseils  spectacle  et 
ciné et les discussions à la pause café. 
 
Cécile  Héraud  a  également  beaucoup  donné  pour  ce  travail.  Elle  a  chouchouté  et 
mis en collection les centaines de souches de champignons et de bactéries que j'ai 
isolées  et  elle  s'est  cassé  les  dents  sur  la  mise  au  point  des  PCR  de  facteur 
d'élongation  Rhizo,  toujours  avec  grand  professionnalisme  et  beaucoup  (trop?)  de 
discrétion. Merci beaucoup Cécile.  
 
Abel Yanougo Konate a été mon stagiaire pendant une année. Le climat français n'a 
pas été tendre avec lui et le soleil burkinabé lui a sûrement manqué plus d'une fois, 
et je le remercie pour le travail qu'il a fourni pendant son passage au labo. 
 
Ce  travail  doit  également  beaucoup  à  Barbara  Burakowski  pour  la  préparation  des 
milieux, les autoclaves et pour le matériel, toujours propre et à sa place, à Bernard 
Le  Bihan,  responsable  informatique  râleur  mais  efficace,  à  Delphine  Ramillon  et 
Sébastien  Brenot  qui  veillent  sur  les  essais  en  serre  et  à  Arnaud  Bartet  qui  m'a 
appris  le  maniement  de  la  perceuse  à  cloche!  Merci  également  à  toutes  les

La vie au labo aurait été moins drôle sans Céline Janvier, ma "maîtresse" de stage 
du tout début qui m'a appris beaucoup et avec qui on a vraiment bien rigolé. Merci à 
tous  les  stagiaires,  thésards  et  permanents,  Abdel,  Amandine,  Noémie,  Mélanie,

Enfin  merci  à  tous  ceux  qui  comptent  pour  moi,  tous  mes  amis,  en  particulier  les 
Boubous  dont  j'ai fait  la  connaissance au  milieu  de  ma  thèse  et  avec  qui  les  mardi 
soirs et les week-ends n'ont plus jamais été comme avant. Merci à ma famille, mes 
parents et ma sœur que j'aime. Merci à mes grand-mères qui ont toujours été fières 
de moi et à mes grand-pères qui, j'en suis sûre, l'auraient été.

Résumé 
 
 

La  qualité  de  présentation  d'une  pomme  de  terre  de  consommation,  Solanum 
tuberosum  L.,  commercialisée  en  produit  frais  est  devenue  une  exigence  et  un  enjeu 
économique  significatif  dans  les  relations  commerciales.  Compte  tenu  du  mode  de 
reproduction  par  voie  végétative  de  cette espèce,  ces  exigences sont  également  imposées 
au  tubercule  de  semence.  Organe  de  réserve  et  de  propagation,  le  tubercule  est  produit 
sous terre, ce qui l'expose aux microorganismes telluriques et le rend potentiellement porteur 
d'altérations superficielles dont l'origine n'est pas encore clairement identifiée pour certaines 
d'entre elles. 
L'objectif  de  ce  travail  est  de  recenser  et  de  caractériser  ces  altérations  superficielles  du 
tubercule et d'en déterminer les causes. Après l'établissement d'une nomenclature et d'une 
classification consensuelles des défauts observables sur tubercule, deux hypothèses ont été 
formulées  et  testées:  (1)  les  défauts  sont  d'origine  pathogène  et/ou  (2)  ils  résultent  d'une 
réponse de la plante à des stress environnementaux.  
L'évaluation  de  la  première  hypothèse  a  mené  à  l'identification  d'une  grande  diversité  de 
microorganismes  vivant  à  la  surface  des  tubercules  altérés.  Leur  pouvoir  pathogène  a  été 
testé par une série de tests biologiques. Ceux-ci ont permis de reproduire les défauts sur des 
tubercules  néoformés  et  de  vérifier  les  postulats  de  Koch  pour  le  champignon  Rhizoctonia 
solani responsable de la formation de sclérotes. Pour bon nombre d'autres défauts visuels, 
aucune  relation  claire  entre  un  microorganisme  et  une  altération  n'a  pu  être  établie.  Une 
étude de la structure des communautés microbiennes de la géocaulosphère de tubercules, 
altérés ou non, a démontré que les communautés fongiques et bactériennes se comportaient 
selon des dynamiques différentes au cours de la culture et en fonction de l'état sanitaire du 
tubercule de semence mais aucune relation de causalité n'a pu être mise en évidence. Il a 
par  contre  été  noté  une  augmentation  de  la  population  de  R.  solani  autour  des  tubercules 
altérés.  La  diversité  des  isolats  d’origine  française  et  européenne  associés  aux  altérations 
des tubercules a donc été caractérisée. Elle révèle l'existence de relations phylogénétiques 
indépendantes  de  l'origine  géographique  et  du  cultivar  hôte  et  suggère  l'existence  de 
d'événements génétiques fréquents et d'un brassage génétique entre les populations de R. 
solani. Le test de la seconde hypothèse a consisté à rechercher une implication potentielle 
de  différents  facteurs  abiotiques  dans  la  formation  des  altérations  superficielles.  L'analyse 
d'une  enquête  menée  auprès  d'agriculteurs  a  mis  en  évidence  l'implication  du  pH,  de 
certaines pratiques culturales, de la sensibilité de cultivars et de conditions météorologiques 
particulières dans l'occurrence de certains défauts.  
Ce travail a permis de clarifier la nomenclature des altérations, de confirmer l'implication de 
R. solani dans l'apparition de certaines d'entre elles et d'envisager de nouvelles hypothèses 
quant  à  la  formation  de  défauts  suite  à  une  réponse  de  la  plante  à  un  stress 
environnemental. Ainsi, une voie a été ouverte vers la résolution de la problématique posée 
par toute une filière professionnelle, responsable de la mise en marché d'un produit frais de 
grande consommation, et répondant aux exigences du marché en matière de présentation, 
qualité culinaire et, mode de production respectueux de l'environnement.

Abstract 
 
 

the  microbial  structure  of 

The visual quality of fresh potatoes, Solanum tuberosum, became a dominant 
criterion  and  a  significative  economical  issue  in  potato  market.  According  the 
vegetative  reproduction  of  this  species,  requirements  for  visual  quality  are  also 
needed  for  potato  seed  tubers.  As  an  organ  for  reserve  and  propagation,  the  tuber 
grows  underground  and  is  in  contact  with  soil-borne  microorganisms,  making  it 
potentially exposed to blemishes, for the majority of which the origin is still unclear. 
The  objective  of  this  work  is  to  make  an  inventory  of  those  tuber  blemishes,  to 
characterize them and determine their causes. After the establishment of consensual 
nomenclature  and  classification  of  the  blemishes,  two  hypotheses  were  formulated: 
(1) blemishes are due to pathogenic attacks and/or (2) they result from a response of 
the plants to environmental stresses. 
The  assessment  of  the  first  hypothesis  allowed  identifying  a  wide  diversity  of 
microorganisms living on the blemished tuber surface. Their pathogenicity was tested 
by several biological assays that allowed producing blemishes on progeny tubers and 
fulfilling the Koch's postulates for the fungus Rhizoctonia solani causing sclerotia. For 
relationship  was  established  between  a 
many  other  blemishes  no  clear 
microorganism  and  a  blemish.  A  study  of 
the 
geocaulosphere  of  tubers  blemished  or  not,  showed  that  bacterial  and  fungal 
communities adopted different dynamics during the growing season and according to 
the sanitary status of the seed tuber, but no causality link could have been drawn. On 
the  other  hand,  an  increase  of  R.  solani  population  around  blemished  tubers  was 
observed.  The  diversity  of  strains  of  R.  solani  originating  from  France  and  from 
Europe and associated to the blemished tubers was characterized. The phylogenetic 
relationships between the strains were independent of the geographical origin and of 
the  host  cultivar,  thus  the  existence  of  frequent  genetic  events  and  genetic  mixing 
between the populations of R. solani was suggested. 
Concerning  the  potential  implication  of  different  abiotic  factors,  a  survey  conducted 
with farmers showed the implication of soil pH, some cultural practices, including the 
choice  of  the  susceptible  cultivars  and  meteorological  conditions  on  the  occurrence 
of some blemishes.  
This  work  made  clear  the  blemish  nomenclature,  confirmed  the  implication  of  R. 
solani  in  the  occurrence  of  some  blemishes  and  suggested  new  hypotheses 
concerning  the  occurrence  of  blemishes  as  a  plant  response  to  a  stressful 
environment. Thus,  a path  was  opened  toward  the  resolution of  the  issue asked  by 
all the potato community, responsible for the marketing of a mass consumption fresh 
product and answering to market requirements related to visual and culinary qualities 
and to environmental friendly modes of production. 
 
Keywords:  potato,  tuber,  blemish,  microorganism,  environmental  stress,  cultural 
practice, microbial community, Rhizoctonia solani.

Preface 

Potato  (Solanum  tuberosum)  originated  in  the  Andes  Mountains  of  South 

America  where  Andeans  people  used  to  eat  it  since  millennia.  Recent  evidence 

suggests  that  potato  was  domesticated  10,000  years  ago  near  Titicaca  Lake,  in  an 

area  that  is  now  the  border  between  Bolivia  and  Peru,  and  where  the  greatest 

diversity  of  wild  species  is  still  to  be  found.  First  record  of  potato  in  Europe  dates 

back in 1573 in Spain but it is only in the early seventeenth century that it becomes 

an  important  food  and  came  back  across  the  Atlantic  ocean  to  North  America 

(Stevenson et al., 2001).  

Potato crop is the fourth main food crop in the world after maize, rice and wheat with 

325  million  tons  produced  in  2007  (Table  0.1).  This  is  also  the  world’s  number  one 

non-grain food commodity and is integrated in the international food system. Despite 

potato  trading  is  not  as  well  developed  as  cereal  trading  on  the  global  markets, 

efforts  are  made  to  promote  potato  spread  all  over  the  world.  The  year  2008  was 

declared  international  year  of  the  potato  by  the  FAO  (Food  and  Agriculture 

Organization). 

Indeed,  potato  can  help 

fulfilling 

the 

first  ONU's  millennium 

development goal that aims at eradicating extreme poverty and hunger in the world. 

The potato produces more nutritious food more quickly, on less land, and in harsher 

climates  than  any  other  major  crop.  Up  to  85  percent  of  the  plant  is  edible  human 

food,  compared  to  around  50  %  in  cereals.  Potatoes  have  good  gustative  and 

nutritional  qualities;  they  are  rich  in  carbohydrates,  making  them  a  good  source  of 

energy.  A  single  medium-sized  potato  contains  about  half 

the  vitamin  C 

recommended daily  intake  -  and  contains  a fifth of  the  recommended  daily  value  of 

potassium (FAO, 2008).

Potatoes are grown in more than 100 countries, mainly in Asia (135 million tons) and 

Europe  (130  million  tons)  (Table  1)  (FAO,  2008),  under  temperate,  subtropical  and 

tropical  conditions.  This  crop  is  from  an  agronomical  point  of  view  well  suited  to 

places where land is limited and labour can be abundant, conditions that characterize 

much  of  the  developing  world,  although  it  is  essentially  a  "cool  weather  crop".  For 

that reason, potatoes are planted in early spring in temperate zones and late winter 

in  warmer  regions,  and  grown  during  the  coolest  months  of  the  year  in  hot  tropical 

climates. In some sub-tropical highlands, mild temperatures and high solar radiation 

allow  farmers  to  grow  potatoes  throughout  the  year,  and  harvest  tubers  within  90 

days of planting. In temperate climates, such as in northern Europe, it can take up to 

150 days (FAO, 2008). As well as being a staple food, potato is also processed into 

French  fries,  crisps  and  is  used  for  dried  products  and  starch  production.  In  some 

countries, potato is still used for animal feeding but this use is decreasing. In many 

countries  in  Asia,  Africa,  Central  and  South  America,  there  is  a  need  for  high  and 

stable  potato  production  to  meet  increasing  food  demands  from  human  population 

growth  during  the  current  period  of  environmental  (including  climate)  change 

(Vreugdenhil, 2007).  

Over the last 10 years, world potato production has increased at an annual average 

rate  of  4.5  percent  especially  in  developing  countries.  Potato  consumption  is 

declining  in  Europe  and  is  increasing  in  developing  world  with  a  global  average  of 

31.3 kg per capita and per year. France is the tenth potato producer in the world with 

6.3 million tons and French people consume about 40 kg of fresh potatoes and 25 kg 

of  transformed  products  per  capita  and  per  year.  Main  French  potato  production 

areas  are  located  in  the  North  (Nord-Pas-de-Calais,  Picardie  and  Champagne-

Ardennes),  West  (Haute-Normandie  and  Bretagne)  and  Center  (Centre)  of  France. 

Total  cultivated  surface  represents  170  000  ha  in  which  100  000  ha  are  used  for 

fresh potatoes production, 25 000 ha for early potatoes, 15 000 ha for seed potatoes 

and 30 000 ha for starch production (FAO, 2008).  

At the European level, France has the leadership for fresh potato production and is 

the  first  exporting  country.  The  exports  are  made  toward  other  European  countries 

among which Spain, Italy, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands and 

Greece  are  the  main  partners  (CNIPT,  2010).  France  also  imports  116  000  tons  of 

 20

Problem statement and thesis outline 

fresh  potatoes  (mostly  for  processing)  and  a  reduced  volume  of  early  potatoes 

coming  from  non  EU-countries  like  Egypt,  Israel  and  Morocco.  Concerning  seed 

potato production, France ranks at the third level after the Netherlands and Germany. 

The annual export volumes are between 80,000 to 100,000 tons towards European 

Union  (Spain,  The  Netherlands,  Belgium,  Portugal,  Italy,  Greece,  Germany,  United 

Kingdom,  and  central  Europe).  Other  destinations  are  North  Africa,  i.e.  Algeria, 

Egypt,  Morocco,  and  Tunisia  and  the  Middle  East  (FNPPPT  and  GNIS,  2007). 

Professional seed organizations such as Bretagne Plants in Brittany, Comité Nord in 

the North and Grocep in the Center of France are also responsible for breeding new 

cultivars. Germicopa, located in Brittany, is one of the oldest European private potato 

breeder, seed producer and trader. All breeding companies select interesting traits of 

plants  and  aim  at  creating  new  hybrids  that  integrate  as  much  positive  traits  as 

possible. 

In  the  North-West  zone  of  Europe,  fresh  potato  consumption  per  capita  has  been 

progressively  declining  in  the  past  twenty  years.  Recent  studies  about  consumer’s 

behavior concerning fresh potato acquisition showed that visual quality - shape and 

smooth aspect of the tubers - was the first choice criterion (59%) well before taste or 

culinary  use.  Soil  particles  on  tuber  surface  may  not  stimulate  the  majority  of  the 

consumers  to  buy  potatoes  which  look  like  dirty  and  have  a  poverty  connotation. 

However,  contradictory  is  the  situation  in  the  organic  market  where  soil  aspect  of 

tubers may represent the authentic and natural connotation of the product (Danielle 

Rapoport Conseil, 2007; CNIPT and TNS-Sofres, 2008). In order to stimulate interest 

for the fresh product and satisfy clients’ expectation, fresh potato professionals have 

put  forward  several  inciting  actions  like  washing  potatoes  before  being  conditioned. 

But  this  action  has had  a major  drawback:  it  highlighted  tuber  blemishes previously 

hidden  by  the  soil  residues  and  lead  to  the  downgrading  of  a  significant  part  of  the 

commodity. 

Indeed,  potatoes  –  whether  they  are  food  or  seed-  are  submitted  to  numerous 

diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, nematodes or viruses. Most of them can affect all 

parts  of  the  plant:  foliage,  berries  tubers  and  root  system,  as  well  as  other 

Solanaceous  hosts.  As  a  consequence,  affected  tubers  used  as  seeds  are  a  very 

powerful  mean  of  further  disease  dispersal.  Transportations  of  tubers  between 

different countries are submitted to control and rules to avoid the spread of diseases. 

Sanitary quality levels are established for both branches of the potato industry, fresh 

 

21

Problem statement and thesis outline 

potatoes  and  seeds.  In  the  certification  scheme  of  seed  potatoes,  strict  regulations 

for  field  and  lot  inspections  are  required  for  the  sanitary  quality  depending  on  seed 

categories and the type of diseases. For example, tubers for basic seeds (class Elite) 

must have less than 5 % of their surface covered by symptoms of R. solani and if the 

disease percentage reaches 5 to 10 %, seeds are downgraded to lower categories (A 

or B). For quarantine diseases (EPPO, 2008b) such as cyst nematodes, wart, ring rot 

or brown rot, no symptoms nor parasitic agents are tolerated.  

Because  the  potato  crop  is  vegetatively  propagated,  the  visual  quality  of  tubers, 

intertwined  with  its  sanitary  status,  is  then  a  consecutive  requirement  for  seed 

production since it is a pre-requisite for ware potato. Among superficial blemishes of  

the  tuber,  most  of  them  are  due  to  well  known  and  studied  pathogens  but  others, 

called  atypical  blemishes,  have  not  yet  known  causes  thus  making  cultural  control 

very difficult and inefficient.  

In order to help potato growers to better know the causes of these blemishes and find 

technical solutions for improving the potato quality, Bretagne Plants and Germicopa 

have launched a 3-year Program of Collaborative Research (PRC) with the financial 

support of the Regional Council of Brittany and in collaboration with the laboratory of 

Soil  and  Environmental  Microbiology  (MSE)  at 

INRA  (National 

Institute  of 

Agronomical  Research).  The  locally  based  industrial  company,  Végénov-Bretagne 

Biotechnologie Végétale (BBV), has also contributed to the project.  

The objectives of this project are 

-  To  propose  clear  and  consensual  terminology  and  classification  of  the 

different blemishes that can be observed on the tuber surface. 

-  To  determine  whether  the  blemishes  are  caused  by  microorganisms,  abiotic 

-  To  identify  environmental  friendly  products  controlling  the  blemishes  and  to 

factors, or both. 

optimize their use. 

This  manuscript  presents  the  PhD  work  carried  out  to  fulfill  the  two  first  objectives 

(Figure 0.1). The third one was treated by BBV.  

A  review  of  the  well  known  pathogenic  microorganisms  of  the  potato  is  carried  out. 

Data  about  the  most  favorable  development  conditions,  their  ecology  and  the 

methods used to detect and quantify them are necessary to set up efficient methods 

for  disease  control.  Moreover,  since  the  use  of  pesticides  is  limited  in  order  to 

prevent  environmental  pollutions,  the  need  of  alternative  control  methods  is 

 22

Problem statement and thesis outline 

becoming stringent. A review of the current available bibliography is presented in the 

Chapter  1  of  this  manuscript.  This  chapter  is  to  be  submitted  to  Agronomy  for 

Sustainable Development. 

Two  consecutive  sampling  campaigns  were  led  to  collect  tubers  presenting 

blemishes in the main French - seed as fresh - potato production areas. Typical and 

atypical blemishes on tuber surface were observed, named and classified in different 

categories. This classification is the subject of Chapter 2 and was submitted to Plant 

Pathology  (Fiers  et  al.,  submitted).  Concerning  the  determination  of  the  blemish 

causes,  two  hypotheses  were  suggested.  First,  the  blemishes  have  a  pathogenic 

origin. This hypothesis was tested by isolations of microorganisms living on the tuber 

surface and pathogenicity tests. This study appears in chapter 3 and is published in 

European  Journal  of  Plant  Pathology  (Fiers  et  al.,  2010).  In  parallel,  Chapter  4, 

submitted to FEMS Microbiology Ecology, treats of the effects of stresses caused by 

the microbial communities living in the nearest surroundings of the tubers, tested by 

molecular methods. As Rhizoctonia solani appeared as an indeniable component of 

the  biotic  factors,  chapter  5  aims  at  characterizing  at  the  intraspecific  level  the 

structure  of  the  populations  of  R.  solani  in  France,  compared  with  those from  other 

countries.  The  second  hypothesis  suggests 

that 

the  blemishes  result 

from 

environmental  stresses  leading  to  a  reaction  of  the  plant.  A  survey  was  carried  out 

with several French potato producers to determine the soil traits of the fields and the 

cultural practices. The results are described and discussed in chapter 6. Eventually, 

the results of this work are discussed and prospects are suggested.

Potato  crop  is  the  fourth  main  food  crop  in  the  world  and  it  will  certainly  feed  a  big 

part  of  the  global  population  in  the  next  years.  The  economical  outlets  for  this  crop 

are  great;  however,  numerous  diseases  either  soil-borne  or  air-borne  can  cause 

huge losses in the production. Worldwide about 40 soil-borne diseases affect potato 

and  cause  severe  damages  especially  on  tubers,  the  economically  most  important 

part of the plant. The occurrence and development of soil-borne diseases depend on 

very diverse factors affecting either the pathogen or the plant. Favourable conditions 

for potato disease development are frequently the same as the conditions needed for 

potato growth: temperature between 10°C and 25°C, h igh humidity, medium pH etc. 

Adapted  cultural  practices  such  as  a  rotation  longer  than  4  years,  minimum  soil 

tillage,  an  adapted  delay  between  dehaulming  and  harvest,  dry  and  cool  conditions 

for  tuber  storage  are  good  ways  to  control  potato  diseases.  In  most  cases,  potato 

pathogens develop specific survival forms, dissemination ways and host penetration 

methods.  The  genetic  variability  of  the  pathogens  implies  the  use  of  adapted 

diagnostic and control methods. Decision support systems developed to predict yield 

losses  allow  choosing  good  control  methods  such  as  the  use  of  healthy  seeds, 

adapted  pesticides,  cultural  practices  and  biological  control  agents  for  each  potato 

diseases.  The  complexity  of  the  interactions  between  a  pathogen  and  its  host, 

influenced  by  biotic  and  abiotic  factors  of  the  environment,  make  the  control  of  the 

diseases very difficult. However, deep knowledge of pathosystems allows setting up 

integrated  pest  management  systems  allowing  the  production  of  healthy  and  good 

quality potatoes.

Introduction 

Potato  crop,  the  world’s  number  one  non-grain  food  commodity,  is  the fourth 

main  food  crop  in  the  world  after  maize,  rice  and  wheat,  with  325  million  tons 

produced  in  2007.  Potatoes  are  grown  in  more  than  100  countries,  mainly  in  Asia 

(135  million  tons)  and  Europe  (130  million  tons)  (FAO,  2008).  They  have  good 

gustative  and  nutritional  qualities  and  can  be  grown  under  various  climates.  This  is 

the reason why FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) has declared the year 2008 

the  international  year  of  the  potato  Indeed,  potato  can  help  fulfilling  the  first  ONU's 

millennium development goal that aims at eradicating extreme poverty and hunger in 

the world. However, potato (Solanum tuberosum) crop can suffer more than 40 pests 

and  diseases  caused  by  insects,  nematodes,  viruses,  bacteria  and  fungi.  Those 

pathogens are air-borne or soil-borne and cause damages on all parts of the plant. In 

this  review,  we  will  focus  on  soil-borne  fungi,  bacteria  and  nematodes  (Table  1.1, 

Figure 1.1).  

Diseases  caused  by  viruses  or  viroïds  provoke  generally  foliar  symptoms:  leaf 

distortion,  mosaic,  crinkling,  leaf  and  vein  necroses,  dwarfing  and  leaf  rolling.  Only 

some viruses - tobacco rattle virus (TRV), potato mop-top virus (PMTV), potato virus 
Y (PVYntn) and tobacco necrosis virus (TNV) - can cause damages on tubers such as 

blemishes or rots in tuber flesh (Table 1.1). They will not be considered in this review 

because  they  are  not  originating  from  soil-borne  pathogens  but  depend  on  aphids, 

fungi or nematodes to be transmitted.  

Soil-borne diseases affecting potato crop can be divided into two groups depending 

on  symptoms:  symptoms  damaging  tubers  and  those  damaging  other  parts  of  the 

plant (Gudmestad et al., 2007).  

Diseases  affecting  stems  or  roots  affect  the  crop  development  and  may  lead  to  a 

reduction  of  the  yield  (Table  1.1).  Stem  lesions  can  be  watery  and  they  develop  to 

the  stem  pith  with  (stem  rot)  or  without  the  formation  of  sclerotia  (black  leg,  white 

mold).  Other  lesions  can  appear  like  more  discrete  light  brown  lesions  but 

nevertheless  they  affect  the  yield  of  the  crop  (skin  spot,  stem  canker).  Soil-borne 

pathogens (Phoma leaf spot, Verticillium wilt) sometimes cause aerial symptoms like 

necroses or chloroses occasionally associated with wilting and rolling (bacterial ring 

29

 
 
rot).  Finally  root  lesions,  mainly  caused  by  nematodes  feeding  on  the  roots  lead  to 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

necroses  or  rots.  Nematodes  feeding  sites  are  good  entry  points  for  other  soil 

microorganisms, which increase the destruction of the roots.

Among  diseases  affecting  tubers,  symptoms  can  be  divided  into  three  categories: 

galls, blemishes and rots (Table 1.1). Galls causes outgrowth and tuber deformation. 

The  most  frequent  galls  are  known  as  powdery  scab,  wart,  common  and  netted 

scabs, root-knot nematode and false root-knot nematode.  

Blemishes  affect  only  the  tuber  skin  but  they  became  economically  important  since 

consumers'  habits  have  changed  and  tubers  are  washed  before  selling.  Blemishes 

can appear on the tuber surface as spots called black dot, black scurf, skin spot or 

powdery  scab)  or  as  areas  of  atypical  appearance  presenting  a  more  or  less 

 

a 

c

pronounced scabby (common scab) or silver (silver scurf) aspect. Rots, which affect 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

the  tuber  flesh  more  deeply,  include  different  types  such  as  dry  rots,  soft  rots 

(charcoal rot, leak, bacterial soft rot, black leg, and stem rot), flesh discoloration (pink 

rot)  or  vascular  ring  discoloration  (ring  rot,  brown  rot,  Verticillium  wilt,  Fusarium  dry 

rots). Dry rot diseases also damage stored potatoes. 

Potato becoming a more and more important foodstuff in the world, it is essential to 

control diseases, which cause direct yield losses and decrease of farmer’s incomes 

due  to  downgrading  the  quality  of  affected  tubers.  Therefore,  knowledge  about  the 

pathogens as well as factors influencing disease severity is needed to set up efficient 

control  strategies.  Before  reviewing  the  different  causes  of  occurrence  and 

development  of  the  main  soil-borne  potato  diseases  it  is  important  to  recall  the 

concepts  of  soil  inoculum  potential  and  soil  suppressiveness  which  describe  the 

complex interactions between the soil, the pathogens and the plant.  

Plant  diseases  result  from  the  compatible  interactions  between  a  susceptible  host 

plant  and  a  pathogen.  These  direct  interactions  are  important  but  should  not 

outshadow  the  key  role  of  environmental factors,  which  influence  these  interactions 

and  thereby  disease  incidence  or  severity.  In  contrast  to  aerial  diseases,  the  soil-

borne  diseases  are  induced  by  pathogens  which  are  embedded  in  the  soil  matrix. 

Thus,  the  soil  interferes  in  many  ways  in  the  relationships  between  and  among 

microorganisms, pathogens and host plant. It can even modify the interaction among 

microorganisms themselves. In some soils, disease incidence or severity commonly 

remain  low  in  spite  of  the  presence  of  the  pathogen,  a  susceptible  host  plant  and 

favourable climatic conditions. They are called disease suppressive soils (Messiha et 

al., 2007; Steinberg et al., 2007). Soil suppressiveness to diseases depends on the 

pathogen  itself  -  its  inoculum  density  and  its  intrinsic  aggressiveness  -  and  also  on 

different soil factors, including both biotic and abiotic components.  

In the first part of this paper, the influence of abiotic factors on disease severity  will 

be  reviewed.  Then  the  characteristics  of  the  inoculum  and  its  relationships  with  the 

rest of the microbiota will be considered.  Finally, risk assessment models, decision 

support systems and control strategies based on collected data will be discussed.

I. Effects of abiotic factors on occurrence and development of soil-borne 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

potato diseases  

Soil abiotic components such as texture, organic matter content, pH as well as 

temperature  and  moisture  greatly  affect  the  behaviour  of  the  pathogens  and 

determine disease incidence or severity. 

I. 1.  Soil temperature 
 

Temperature and moisture of the soil are obviously greatly dependent on the climatic 

conditions,  but  also  of  some  cultural  practices  such  as  irrigation.  Temperature  is  of 

major importance in disease development since it determines pathogen growth rate 

(Baljeet  et  al.,  2005),  kind  of  symptoms  (Bouchek-Mechiche  et  al.,  2000b)  and 

geographical distribution of the diseases. Most of the potato pathogens can grow at 

soil temperatures between 10°C and 25 °C, the optim al potato growth temperatures 

(Table  1.2).  However,  gangrene,  black  scurf  and  powdery  scab  are  favoured  by 

mean temperatures below 15°C (Baker, 1970; Gindrat,  1984; Harrison, 1997); on the 

contrary, black dot, black leg, stem rot and charcoal rot are favoured by temperatures 

above  27°C.  Similarly,  sting  and  root-knot  nematode s  reproduce  better  between 

25°C  and  30°C 

to  35°C  depending  on 

the  origin  of 

th e  populations.

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

 

 

I. 2.  Soil moisture 
 

Soil  moisture  which  depends  on  the  climate  and  cultural  practise  is  also 

determined by the soil texture (see below). In the literature dealing with interactions 

between  soil  moisture  and  potato  diseases,  many  different  terms  are  used  to 

characterize the water soil content.  

Soil moisture content, moisture-weight percentage and water holding capacity 

(whc)  are  used  to  evaluate  the  volume  of  water  contained  in  soil.  It  is  generally 

expressed as a percentage of the soil's dry weight. Other publications refer to water 

activity which is a dimensionless quantity (between 0 and 1) describing the amount of 

free  water  in  soil  for  biochemical  reactions.  Water  activity,  which  depends  on  soil 

texture,  is  related  to  moisture  content  in  a  non-linear  relationship  known  as  a 

moisture sorption isotherm curve.  

High soil moisture due to abundant rainfalls, poor drainage, heavy soils or irrigation, 

influences  disease  development  and  the  opening  of  the  lenticels  which  are  further 

entry points for soil-borne pathogens into the tuber (Helias, 2008). Several diseases, 

especially bacterial diseases, are enhanced by high moisture content (Table 1.2), but 

few diseases are favoured by low levels of moisture. This is the case for black dot, 

some dry rots induced by Fusarium spp., stem rot, wart, common scab, and sting and 

root-knot  nematodes.  High  soil  moisture  generally  has  indirect  effects  which  might 

favour disease severity. This is the case of  flooding that provokes oxygen depletion 

and CO2 enrichment resulting in an increase of Spongospora subterranea (powdery 

scab) development (Harrison, 1997). In some cases, the influence of soil moisture on 

disease severity is not clearly demonstrated. Depending on the studies, black scurf, 

stem canker, silver scurf (Helminthosporium solani) and Thecaphora smut (T. solani) 

are  either  positively  or  negatively  correlated  with  soil  moisture  (Adams  et  al.,  1987; 

Hide and Firmager, 1989; Sepulveda et al., 2000; El Bakali and Martin, 2006; Wale et 

al.,  2008).  Conversely,  high  relative  humidity  during  storage  of tubers  has  always  a 

negative impact (Table 1.2).  

 

 

 

 

 38

 

I. 3.   Soil texture 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

The  soil  texture  described  the  relative  percentage  of  sand,  loam  and  clay 

contents.  Most  of  fungal  diseases  are  enhanced  in  light  sandy  soils  (Table  1.3). 

Conversely, it is generally accepted that clay soils favour bacterial activity (Marshall, 

1975;  Alabouvette  et al.,  1996)  explaining  that  clay  or  heavy  soils  are  conducive  to 

bacterial  soil-borne  diseases  (ring  rot,  soft  rot,  brown  rot  and  netted  scab). 

Concerning nematodes, no general rule can be drawn up as some species are more 

prevalent in heavy soils (root-knot nematodes) and other species in light soils (sting 

nematodes).  Soil  texture  also  influences  soil  structure,  through  the  distribution  of 

different  pore  sizes,  determining  the  actual  living  space  for  bacteria,  fungi  and 

predators.  It  also  influences  the  water  activity;  water  retained  in  pores  of  narrow 

diameter being less available for organisms that water present in big pores.

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

I. 4.   Soil pH 
 

Disease  development  is  also  influenced  by  the  soil  pH  linked  to  soil  nutrient 

availability (Table 1.3). Soils with extreme pH values are often highly suppressive to 

several  plant  diseases  (Höper  and  Alabouvette,  1996).  However,  pH  fluctuations 

resulting 

from  amendments 

influence  pathogens  and  disease  development. 

Decreasing pH increases the availability of phosphorus, nitrogen and aluminium ions 

and  decreases  potato  cyst  nematode,  brown  rot  and  common  scab  damages 

respectively  (Mulder  et  al.,  1997;  Michel  and  Mew,  1998;  Ruijter  and  Haverkort, 

1999;  Mizuno  et  al.,  2003).  On  the  contrary,  addition  of  urea  in  soil  induces  a  very 

large  increase  in  pH  and  a  good  control  of  Synchitrium  endobioticum,  the  fungal 

pathogen causing wart (Hampson, 1985).  

Soil  organic  matter  is  both  the  substrate  for  and  the  result  of  microbial  activity.  In 

addition,  together  with  clay,  organic  matter  affects  soil  structure  and  thus  moisture 

content  and  aeration.  The  quantity  of  organic  matter  in  a  soil  has  an  effect  on  the 

appearance and the development of diseases but its quality is also an important point 

which has been too poorly addressed (Alabouvette et al., 1996).  

I. 5.   Soil organic matter 
 

Soil organic matter is both the substrate for and the result of microbial activity. 

In addition, together with clay, organic matter affects soil structure and thus moisture 

content  and  aeration.  The  quantity  of  organic  matter  in  a  soil  has  an  effect  on  the 

appearance and the development of diseases but its quality is also an important point 

which has been too poorly addressed (Alabouvette et al., 1996).  

Most  physico-chemical  factors  are  not  independent  one  from  the  others,  which 

makes  experiments  and  data  interpretation  very  difficult.  Soil  texture  can  affect 

humidity, soil amendments impact on pH and all those factors influence availability of 

chemical elements. Thus, the pathogenic inoculum present either in the soil or on the 

tuber surface has to find the optimal climatic and edaphic conditions to develop.

II. 1.   Autecology of pathogens 
 

1. 1. Inoculum sources, survival and dissemination pathways 

The  survival  of  soil-borne  pathogens  during  periods  without  potato  crop 

depends on their ability to resist to unfavourable conditions. Most of them survive in 

soil  under  the  form  of  resistant  structures  able  to  directly  infect  the  new  host  crop. 

Some  pathogens  can  also  survive  as  saprophytes  on  host  crop  residues  or  on 

alternative  hosts  during  winter.  Finally,  inoculum  can  also  be  introduced  in  the  field 

by the seeds; it is called seed-borne or tuber-borne inoculum. Inoculum sources are 

diverse  and  for  any  disease  several  inoculum  sources  can  play  a  role  (Table  1.4). 

Soil-borne  fungi  produce  different  conservation  structures.  Fusarium  spp.  forms 

chlamydospores resistant to adverse conditions, Rhizoctonia solani, Verticillium spp., 

Sclerotinia sclerotinium overwinter as sclerotia. Bacteria can survive over winter with 

favourable  moisture,  temperature  and  soil  type  (Ficke  et  al.,  1973;  Bradbury,  1977; 

Loria  et  al.,  2008).    Nematodes  can  survive  and  persist  in  soil  as  protective  cysts 

surrounding  the  eggs  (Globodera  spp.)  or  as  juveniles  in  host  roots  (Meloidogyne 

spp.) (Qian et al., 1996; Wharton and Worland, 2001).  

In  absence  of  resistant  structures  and  of  efficient  saprophytic  abilities,  some 

pathogens  need  alternative  hosts  to  survive  in  absence  potatoes. These  alternative 

hosts frequently belong to the Solanaceous family and act as a long term reservoir of 

the pathogen (Chang et al., 1992; Tomlinson et al., 2005). 

Fungal  dissemination  occurs  frequently  as  spores  (conidiospores,  chlamydospores, 

pycnidiospores, sporangiospores, oospores and zoospores) or mycelium transported 

by  water  (rain,  irrigation,  and  flow  in  soil),  by  soil  adhering  to  farm  equipment  or 

introduced  by  contaminated  seed  tubers  (Zambolim  et  al.,  1995;  Stevenson  et  al., 

2001;  Bae  et  al.,  2007).  Moreover,  some  pathogens  liberate  mobile  dissemination 

forms such as zoosporanges. Zoospores of P. erythroseptica, S. subterranea and S. 

endobioticum  are  responsible  for  short  distance  dissemination  of  these  pathogens 

(Wharton  et  al.,  2007;  Merz  and  Falloon,  2009).  Adult  nematodes  such  as  P. 

 

 

 

 

penetrans  are  able  to  migrate  on  quite  long  distances  better  than  do  larvae 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

(Pudasaini et al., 2007).  

 

1.2. Relationship between inoculum density and disease severity 
 

Although there is not always a clear and linear relationship, the severity of the 

disease  generally  increases  with  an  increasing  level  of  inoculum  (Table  1.4). 

Sometimes  a  minimum  inoculum  threshold  is  needed  to  initiate  the  disease 

development.  This  is  the  case  for  potato  cyst  nematode  (Samaliev  et  al.,  1998). 

Conversely, the disease severity of black dot does not increase any more beyond a 

maximum threshold of inoculum density (Nitzan et al., 2008). In fact as stated above, 

the  relationship  between  inoculum  density  and  disease  severity  greatly  depends  on 

the environmental factors which determine the level of soil suppressiveness.

1. 3. Mechanisms of infection 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

Potato plants are essentially composed of cellulose, a very solid polymer and 

tubers  are  enveloped  in  a  protective  covering  called  periderm  made  of  a  suberin 

biopolymer providing the primary barrier against disease, insects, dehydratation, and 

physical intrusions for the potato tuber (Lulai, 2001). Soil-borne pathogens of potato 

have various ways to penetrate the host plant and break physical barriers. They enter 

the  roots,  young  sprouts,  underground  stem,  stolons  or  tubers.  Some  pathogens 

cannot  infect  intact  tuber  periderm  or  lenticels  and  penetrate  through  wounds 

(Stevenson et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2004) whereas other pathogens can penetrate 

either  directly  by  mechanical  and/or  enzymatic  degradation  of  the  host's  cells  or 

through natural openings (stomata, lenticels, eyes) (Table 1.5). 

Once  they  have  penetrated  the  host,  pathogens  colonize  plant  tissues.  Fungi  grow 

through the parenchyma of the cortex and often reach the vascular vessels. T. solani, 

S.  endobioticum  and  Streptomyces  spp.  penetration  provokes  hypertrophy  of  the 

colonized tissues resulting in galls. They grow in the plant, induce cell death and feed 

on them saprophytically. They secrete phytotoxins – for example thaxtomin produced 

by  Streptomyces  spp.  -  inducing  the  formation  of  several  layers  of  suberized  corky 

cells, creating a large lesion firmly integrated within the tuber skin (Stevenson et al., 

2001;  Mulder  et  al.,  2008;  Perez  and  Torres,  2008).  Compared  to  common  scab, 

powdery scab pustules formation is a relatively short process, at the end of which a 

single wound-cork layer remains that covers the entire lesion. After hardening off, this 

layer  can  be  easily  removed  from  the  lesion  without  any  damage  of  the  underlying 

tissues  (Delleman  et  al.,  2005).  C.  coccodes,  H.  solani,  P.  pustulans,  R.  solani,  S. 

subterranea and Streptomyces spp. are responsible for several superficial alterations 

called  blemishes.  Colonization  by  those  pathogens  is  usually  limited  to  superficial 

layers of tuber periderm (Harrison, 1997; Stevenson et al., 2001; Cunha and Rizzo, 

2004; Lehtonen et al., 2008a; Loria et al., 2008) but they can colonize other parts of 

the plant until they reach vascular system. Streptomyces spp. responsible for netted 

scab  blemishes  have  pathogenic  mechanisms  that  are  assumed  to  not  implicate 

thaxtomin but rather a necrotic protein (Bouchek-Mechiche et al., 2006). 

Fungi and bacteria causing rots produce a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes such as 

cellulases,  pectinases,  xylanases  and  proteases  (Olivieri  et  al.,  2004).  They  are 

 

 48

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

responsible  for  tissue  maceration  and  cell  death,  after  which  the  microorganisms 

have access to the nutritional resources of the dead plant tissues (Amadioha, 1997; 

Aveskamp et al., 2008). Pectobacterium spp. develop an original pathogenic strategy 

based  on  quorum  sensing,  which  utilise  freely  diffusible  chemical  signal  molecules 

allowing  pathogenic  bacteria  to  synchronise  the  production  of  virulence  factors  and 

make  the  pathogenic  attack  more  efficient  (Liu  et  al.,  2008).  Finally,  nematodes 

attacking  potatoes  can  be  classified 

in 

two  categories:  ectoparasites  and 

endoparasites.  Ectoparasites  nematodes  (B.  longicaudatus,  Paratrichodorus  spp. 

and Trichodorus spp.) are mobile and feed on potato roots in the area of cell division 

and elongation without penetrating the root (Stevenson et al., 2001; Mugniéry, 2007). 

The endoparasitic nematodes of potato, D. destructor and P. penetrans are migrating 

endoparasites;  they  feed  from  cell  to  cell  into  the  host,  whereas  Globodera  spp., 

Meloidogyne  spp.  and  N.  aberrans  are  sedentary  endoparasites,  they  induce 

specialized  feeding  sites  in  plant  roots.  D.  destructor  and  P.  penetrans  penetrate 

underground parts of the plant, feed on the cortical cells and migrate into the roots, 

destroying  cell  after  cell.  G.  pallida,  G.  rostochiensis,  Meloidogyne  spp.,  and  N. 

aberrans develop feeding cavities in host root, causing galls (Mugniéry, 2007).

1. 4. Genetic variability 

A  soil-borne  disease  can  be  caused  by  several  species  of  pathogens 

belonging  to  a  single  genus,  by  one  species,  or  even  by  a  subgroup  of  a  species. 

Each  species  or  sub-species  is  adapted  to  particular  conditions  or  variety. 

Knowledge  of  the  genetic  diversity  of  pathogens  is  useful for  precise  diagnosis  and 

control of potato diseases.  

Since Erwinia has been divided into 2 different genera, Pectobacterium and Dickeya 

(Helias, 2008), bacterial soft rot previously attributed to E. carotovora, E. atroseptica 

and  E.  chrysantemi  is  in  fact  one  disease  caused  by  several  species  belonging  to 

different  genera  (Table  1.5).  Pectobacterium  spp.  and  Dickeya  spp.  are  frequently 

associated  with  bacteria  of  the  genus  Clostridium  which  includes  very  numerous 

gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria. C. puniceum is one of the few well-characterized 

pectolytic  clostridia  isolated  from  rotting  potato  tubers  (Stevenson  et  al.,  2001; 

Prescott et al., 2003).  

Within  a  same  species,  the  pathogen  may  belong  to  different  groups  with  various 

genetic,  pathogenic  and  physiological  traits  leading  to  the  characterization  of  races, 

biovars and, recently, genomovars - strains which are phylogenetically differentiable, 

but are phenotypically indistinguishable -, phylotypes and sequevars – one or several 

strains  with  a  given  sequence  -  (Nouri  et  al.,  2009).    Fungi  without  sexual 

reproductive stage, such as Colletotrichum spp., Fusarium spp., or Verticillium spp., 

are  classified  in  vegetative  compatibility  groups  (VCGs).  Within  a  VCG,  hyphae 

belonging  to  different  isolates  can  anastomose  and  form  stable  heterokaryons, 

whereas hyphae from isolates belonging to different VCGs can not. This mechanism 

is  the  only  known  mechanism  of  genetic  exchange  between  individuals  of  asexual 

fungi  (Hiemstra  and  Rataj-Guranowska,  2003).  Hyphal  anastomosis  is  also  used  to 

categorize the isolates of R. solani into anastomosis groups (AG). Presently 13 AGs 

have been described, several of which being divided into subgroups. Individual AGs 

are  not  strictly  associated  with  a  specific  host  or  family  of  hosts,  for  example  AG  1 

with rice and AG 8 with cereals. AG 3 isolates, and more specifically isolates from the 

AG 3 PT subgroup, are often associated with potato diseases (Kuninaga et al., 2000; 

Carling et al., 2002). However it was shown, in Great Britain and France, that AG 2-1 

 
 
 

 

 52

 
 
and AG 5  can  cause disease  in  potato  crops  but  with  a  much  lower  incidence  than 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

AG 3 PT (Campion et al., 2003; Woodhall et al., 2007). 

As  a  result  of  the  genetic  evolution  of  pathogens,  new  pathotypes  are  regularly 

discovered.  Conversely,  some  populations  such  as  P.  erythroseptica  and  C. 

michiganensis  subsp.  sepedonicus  vary  slightly  in  pathogenicity  and  in  genetic 

diversity suggesting a relatively recent introduction of a small founding population of 

the  pathogen  (Smith  et  al.,  2001;  Peters  et  al.,  2005).  Genetic  evolution  can  be 

achieved  by  vertical  or  horizontal  gene  transfer.  Meloidogyne  populations  originally 

did  not  possess  the  cell-wall-degrading  enzymes  required  to  invade  host  roots. 

Although  the  mechanism  of  horizontal  gene  transfer  remains  largely  elusive,  it  has 

been  speculated  that  a  gene  coding  for  a  cell-wall-degrading  enzyme  was 

horizontally transferred from a rhizobial bacterium to the nematode and was kept in 

the  genome  of  the  nematode  by  strong  selection  pressures  representing  important 

initial steps facilitating the invasion of plants by nematodes (Dieterich and Sommer, 

2009).  By  genetic  evolution,  pathogens  can  adapt  to  the  different  environmental 

conditions  they  are  submitted  to.  This  enables  them  to  skirt  control  measures  and 

continuously forced farmers to use new control methods. 

1. 5. Diagnosis and detection methods 

Rapid detection of plant parasitic pathogens enables to set up adapted control 

measures  and  to  avoid  disease  expansion  and  yield  losses,  even  if  the  infestation 

level  is  low.  Classical  detection  methods  begin  with  visual  observation  and 

characterization  of  symptoms  followed  by  identification  using  morphologic  traits  for 

nematodes  (Crow  et  al.,  2000;  Riga  and  Neilson,  2005;  Melakeberhan  et  al.,  2007; 

Mugniéry, 2007) or isolation on selective media for fungi and bacteria. Carbon source 

utilisation,  sugar  degradation  and  production  of  specific  enzymes  allow  the 

biochemical  identification  of  bacteria  (Flores-Gonzalez  et  al.,  2008;  Pitman  et  al., 

2008).  However,  these  classical  methods  are  often  not  accurate  enough  to 

distinguish  different  strains  or  pathovar  of  the  same  species.  Molecular  biology 

based-diagnosis  and  detection  methods  are  expected  to  complement  classical 

diagnosis.  The  most  developed  detection  methods  are  based  on  polymerase  chain 

reaction (PCR), which amplify DNA regions specific of the pathogen of interest (Table 

1.5). Being even more sensitive than classical PCR, RT-PCR is currently among the 

 

 

 

53

 
 
most powerful methods for the diagnosis of pathogens in complex environments. The 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

quantity  of  a  given  pathogen  can  be  measured  by  quantitative  PCR  that  quantify 

pathogen  ARN  initially  present  in  a  sample.  Intraspecific  identifications  such  as 

fingerprinting  methods  -  Restriction  Fragment  Length  Polymorphism  (RFLP)  or 

Amplified  Fragment  Length  Polymorphism  (AFLP)  –  are  used  for  more  accurate 

identification  of  pathovars  or  races  of  bacteria,  fungi  or  nematodes  (Abeln  et  al., 

2002;  Cullen  et  al.,  2007;  Flores-Gonzalez  et  al.,  2008;  Pitman  et  al.,  2008). 

Fluorescent  in-situ  hybridisation  (FISH)  or  stable  low-molecular-weight  (LMW)  DNA 

profiles  were  developed  to  detect  R.  solanacearum  and  C.  michiganensis  var. 

sepedonicum, respectively (Ronda et al., 1999; Palomo et al., 2000). Immunological 

techniques  such  as 

immunochromatographical 

lateral 

flow,  Enzyme-Linked 

Immunosorbent  Assay  (ELISA)  and 

immunofluorescence  are  based  on 

the 

recognition  of  specific  markers  at  the  surface  of  pathogenic  cells  to  detect  and 

identify  the  pathogens  (Ronda  et  al.,  1999;  Merz,  2005;  Hughes,  2008).  Fungal 

pathogens  display  typical  infrared  spectra  that  differ  from  the  spectra  of  substrate 

material such as potato; they can be early and rapidly detected by Fourier transform 

infrared  (FT-IR)  microscopically-based  technique  (Erukhimovitch,  2007).  Finally, 

monitoring of normal and disease-induced volatile profiles in stored potatoes or of the 

light  reflected  from  plant  in  fields  are  valuable  techniques  to  detect  stress  and  thus 

pathogenic infections (Ouellette et al., 1990; Heath et al., 2000).  

II. 2. 

Interactions between microorganisms, organisms and pathogens 
 

Potato  pathogens  are  not  the  only  microorganisms  living  in  the  potato 

surroundings.  A  huge  microbial  biomass  is  associated  and  interacts  with  potatoes. 
About  107  bacteria  colony  forming  units  (CFU)  per  g  of  soil  live  in  the  potato 

rhizosphere and potato geocaulosphere which is the volume of soil surrounding the 

tubers  (Lazarovits  et  al.,  2007).  The  structure  of  microbial  and  nematode 

communities  in  the  geocaulosphere  varies  according  to  the  plant  age  and  other 

factors related to cultivar, nutritional status, biotic and abiotic stresses, etc. (Al-Hazmi 

et  al.,  1993;  Krechel  et  al.,  2002;  Ferreira  et  al.,  2008;  Desgarennes  et  al.,  2009; 

Manici and Caputo, 2009).  

 

 

 54

 
 
Earthworms and nematodes favour pathogens mobility by transporting them through 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

the  soil  (Jensen,  1978)  (Table  1.6).  Nematodes  enhance  potato  diseases  because 

they  act  as  vectors  of  the  pathogens.  They  also  enhance  the  diseases  either  by 

facilitating the development of other pathogens – acting as mechanical wound agents 

and  providers  of  necrotic  tissues  for  pathogen  penetration  or  nutrition  -  or  by 

benefiting of their attacks as opportunistic microorganisms (Jensen, 1978).

suppressiveness  of  the  soil.  Two  classical  types  of  suppressiveness  of  soil  are 

known.  General  suppression  is  related  to  the  global  activity  of  the  whole  microbial 

biomass in the soil. In contrast, specific suppression is due to the specific activity of 

certain  individuals  or  groups  of  microorganisms  (Alabouvette  et  al.,  1996; Weller  et 

al.,  2002).  For  instance,  Serratia  plymuthica,  Pseudomonas  spp.,  Bacillus  spp., 

Streptomyces spp. and Trichoderma spp. (Kumar and Khare, 1990; Kamensky et al., 

2002;  Krechel  et  al.,  2002)  are  able  to  decrease  the  severity  of  several  potato 

diseases  (Table  1.6).  They  can  be  considered  as  biological  control  agents.  Some 

biological  control  agents  can  act  directly  against  fungal  pathogens  by  enzymatic 

degradation of their cell walls (Kamensky et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002), by parasitism – 

as  it  seems  to  be  the  case  against  numerous  nematodes-  (Nunez-Camargo  et  al., 

2003;  Papert  et  al.,  2004),  by  antibiotics  production  (Grosch  et  al.,  2005),  by 

siderophore secretion that reduces the availability of iron needed by plant pathogens 

(Bharadwaj  et  al.,  2008)  or  by  interfering  with  communication  between  pathogens, 

i.e.  by  degrading  molecules  involved  in  the  "quorum  sensing"  mechanisms  of 

Pectobacterium spp.(Dong et al., 2004). Indirectly, biological control agents can lead 

to the plant strengthening and a better resistance to pathogen attacks by producing 

plant growth hormone or by inducing the production of plant defence molecules such 

as phytoalexins and PR proteins (Stevenson et al., 2001; Larkin, 2008). Mycorrhizal 

fungi  also  have  a  beneficial  effect;  inoculation  with  arbuscular  mycorhizal  fungus 

suppressed tuber dry rot and reduced stem canker and black scurf (Bharadwaj et al., 

Interactions between plants and pathogens 

The major method to control potato diseases is to find resistant cultivars to a 

majority  of  pathogens  especially  since  the  use  of  chemicals  is  limited  (INRA  and 

Cemagref,  2005;  Paillotin,  2008).  Different  levels  of  resistance  towards  most  of  the 

soil-borne potato diseases have been observed among potato cultivars. Wild species 

of  Solanum  provide  excellent  sources  of  disease  resistance  genes  that  may  be 

introgress  into  S.  tuberosum  genome  by  interspecific  crossing  (Jansky  and  Rouse, 

2003) (Table 1.7) and international structures such as the International Potato Center 

2008).

in Peru are aiming at preserving the genetic diversity of native potatoes. Varieties of 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

potato which contain colour pigments are more and more utilized in current breeding 

programmes because cultivars producing anthocyanins can provide better resistance 

to  soft  rot  or  other  diseases  compared  to  white/yellow  flesh  cultivars  (Wegener  and 

Jansen,  2007).  Cultivars  resistant 

to  several  diseases  were  obtained,  but 

simultaneous  resistance  to  all  pathogens  is  very  difficult  to  achieve.  Moreover,  for 

some  diseases,  new  genotypes  of  pathogen  appear  regularly  and  overcome  plant 

defence turning the former resistant cultivars into susceptible ones. Hence the levels 

and durability of field resistance are often highly depending on numerous abiotic and 

biotic factors still not well known neither controlled.

Resistant potato cultivars resist to pathogenic attacks by plant defence reactions that 

generally  lead  to  the  production  of  suberin  and  anti-microbial  agents,  activation  of 

defence genes and trigger hypersensitive cell death (Levine et al., 1994) delaying the 

pathogen  development  in  plant  tissues  until  a  wound  periderm  could  form. 

Susceptible  cultivars  produce  non-uniform  deposits  of  suberin  making  them  less 

performing against pathogens (Finetti Sialer, 1990; Ray and Hammerschmidt, 1998). 

The anti-microbial agents produced by potato can be glycoalkaloids (α-chaconin and 

α-solanine),  phenolic  compounds  and  phytoalexins,  antimicrobial  compounds 

produced by the plant after pathogen attacks (Okopnyi et al., 1983; Lyon, 1989; Ray 

and  Hammerschmidt,  1998;  Zagoskina  et  al.,  2006;  Baker  et  al.,  2008;  Lerat  et  al., 

2009). Plants also produce inhibitors of virulence factors (Kim et al., 2006). An other 

plant  defence  reaction  called  systemic  acquired  resistance  (SAR)  spreads  a  signal 

through  the  surrounding  cells.  It  allows  plants  to  become  highly  resistant  to 

subsequent  infection  by  the  original  pathogen  but  also  by  a  wide  variety  of  other 

 

59

 
 
pathogens. For example, foliar SAR-inducing applications (benzo (1,2,3) thiadiazole-

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

7-carbothioic  acid  S-methyl  ester  -BTH  -  and  harpin)  reduce  the  numbers  of  root-

lesion  nematodes  (Pratylenchus  spp.)  and  root  knot  nematodes,  Meloidogyne 

chitwoodi by potato harvest (Collins et al., 2006).  

 

 

 

 

III. Effects of cultural practices on the occurrence and development of 

soil-borne potato diseases 

Each  technical  choice  made  by  the  farmers  concerning  the  way  of  growing 

potatoes plays a predominant role on the quantitative and qualitative yield at the end 

of the cropping period. All cultural practices may impact disease development. 

III. 1. Rotations 
 

The  most  traditional  way  to  control  diseases  is  to  use  crop  rotations  that 

include a non host plant that can "sanitize" the soil (Alabouvette et al., 1996). Several 

studies  show  good  results  when  potatoes  are  grown  only  one  every  three  or  four 

years (Table 1.8). The beneficial effect of crop rotation depends on the host range of 

the pathogen and its ability to survive in soil in the absence of its host plant thanks to 

dormant  structures  such  as  sclerotia  or  chlamydospores.  Obviously,  crop  rotation 

must  avoid  including  alternative  hosts  for  the  pathogen  (Peters  et  al.,  2004). 

Susceptible weeds - such as hairy nightshade (Solanum sarrachoides) - have to be 

eliminated  as  they  enable  the  pathogen  to  survive  during  the  absence  of  the  main 

host (Boydston et al., 2008). Crop rotation can also fail to control highly specialized 

pathogens, such as Globodera spp. or S. subterranea. These organisms are able to 

survive for long periods, either saprophytically or as dormant structures, in soil, and a 

very low inoculum density is sufficient to induce disease (Samaliev et al., 1998; Merz 

and  Falloon,  2009).  Rotations  with  potatoes  can  include  very  diverse  crops  (Table 

1.8).  If  some  of  those  crops  are  beneficial  effect,  other  might  favour  pathogen 

development  and  should  not  enter  in  the  rotation,  or  at  teast  not  as  the  crop 

preceding the potatoes.

III. 2. Fertilization and amendments 
 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

Supplying plants with micronutrients and macronutrients can be achieved with 

organic  or  inorganic  fertilizers,  either  through  soil  application,  foliar  spray,  or  seed 

treatment  (Davis  et  al.,  1994;  Panique  et  al.,  1997;  Malakouti,  2008).  Adapted 

fertilization and amendment allow strong and healthy crops, which are less attractive 

to pathogens (Khomyakov and Kostin, 1981). Fertilization may also indirectly favour 

diseases  by  enhancing  foliar  development  that  maintain  high  level  of  humidity 

needed for  example for  the  growth  of  Pectobacterium  spp.  (Rousselle  et  al.,  1996). 

Amendments  contribute  to  control  diseases  by  modifying  soil  properties,  especially 

pH (see I.2.) and microbial activities. That could result in specific suppression caused 

by the stimulated specific antagonistic populations or in general suppression caused 

by  increased  microbial  activities  or  both  (Lazarovits  et  al.,  2001;  Steinberg  et  al., 

2007). 

 

For  some  diseases,  such  as  stem  rot,  organic  fertilizers  are  more  efficient  than 

mineral ones in terms of disease suppression (Amitava and Maiti, 2006) (Table 1.8). 

Among  organic  fertlizers  composts  are  known  to  have  the  capacity  to  suppress 

diseases,  depending  on  their  degree  of  maturity  (organic  matter  content,  microbial 

activities).  The  causal  agents  of  disease  suppression  brought  by  compost 

amendment  of  the  soil  are  complexes  of  bacterial  and  fungal  populations,  which 

invade  the  pile  during  the  curing  stage,  although  some  residual  activity  is  probably 

related to fungistatic compounds occurring in the composts (Raviv, 2008).

III. 3. Tillage management 
 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

Potato  cultivation  traditionally  involves  intensive  soil  tillage  throughout  the 

cropping  period.  Mechanical  tillage,  ridging  and  harvesting  entail  intensive  soil 

disturbance  and  modify  the  environmental  conditions  especially  the  microbial 

characteristics of soil, both on quantitative and qualitative aspects (FAO, 2008; Vian, 

2009).  As  an  example,  ploughing  contributes  to  redistribute  vertically  the  inoculum, 

which  increases  the  probability  of  infection  (Taylor,  2005).  Over  the  last  decades, 

there is tend to replace ploughing by techniques without soil inversion i.e. no tillage 

or superficial tillage, leading to efficient disease suppression (Klikocka, 2001; Peters 

et  al.,  2004;  Vian,  2009)  (Table  1.8).  Indeed,  rotation  and  conservation  tillage 

practices  can  improve  disease  suppression  by  enhancing  the  antibiosis  abilities  of 

endophytic and root zone bacteria (Peters et al., 2003). Although minimum tillage is 

more  beneficial  for  soil  suppressiveness  to  disease,  the  plant  growth  and  the 

macronutrient (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) contents in potato plant respond positively to a 

deeper soil caused by ploughing (Boligowa and Glen, 2003; Nunes et al., 2006). 

 

III. 4. Planting, haulm destruction, lifting and harvesting 
 

Planting,  dehaulming, 

lifting  and  harvesting  are  decisive 

for  disease 

expression  (Table  1.8).  For  example,  low  planting  density  increases  the  yield  per 

plant  because  the  foliage  has  more  space  for  growth.  Also,  sparse  plants  are  less 

exposed  to  the  attacks  of  disease  than  plants  at  high  densities  (Milic  et  al.,  2006). 

Diseases  can  be  reduced  by  adjusting  planting,  dehaulming  and  harvesting  dates 

and cultivation of early-tuberizing cultivars combined with pre-harvesting desiccation 

of  haulms  and  treatment  of  seed  tubers  with  chemicals  (Sikka  and  Singh,  1976). 

Black  scurf  development  on  tubers  has  a  positive  correlation  with  the  curing  period 

(time between haulm destruction and harvest) because infection on tubers continues 

in the soil even after haulm destruction (Lakra, 2000).

III. 5. Pesticides  
 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

Pesticides  are  commonly  used  to  control  various  pathogens  altering  potato 

tubers. They can be applied as soil fumigant (fumigants such as carbamates are not 

allowed in some European countries), sprayed or powdered directly on seed tubers 

after harvest or applied as granular (Hide et al., 1995; Tsror et al., 2000; Errampalli et 

al.,  2006).  The  chemicals  have  to  be  carefully  chosen,  since  pathogens  can  adapt 

and  become  resistant  (Table  1.8).  Thiabendazole-resistance  was  detected  in  F. 

avenaceum,  F.  culmorum,  F.  equiseti,  and  F.  sporotrichioides  (Fusarium  dry  rot) 

(Ocamb  et  al.,  2007),  in  Polyscytalum  pustulans  (skin  spot)  (Carnegie  et  al.,  2008) 

and  in  H.  solani  (silver  scurf).  Mefenoxam-resistance  is  known  for  Phytophthora 

erythroseptica (pink rot) populations (Taylor et al., 2006) and numerous treatments of 

carbendazim select resistant mutants of Sclerotium rolfsii (stem rot) (Solunke et al., 

2001). Moreover, the use of numerous chemicals is nowadays regulated and many of 

them are no longer permitted in France.  

 

III. 6. Organic farming versus conventional agriculture 
 

Organic  farming  relies  on  agricultural  techniques  that  exclude  the  use  of 

chemical  pesticides  and  recommend  organic  fertilization.    As  a  result,  the  soil  and 

tuber  environment  is  quite  different  from  the  one  caused  by  conventional  practices 

and  may  induce  disease  suppression  (Table  1.8).  To  reduce  disease  incidence  or 

severity,  the  best  adapted  cultural  system  depends  on  the  pathogen  to  control  and 

varys strongly according to the soil type (Messiha et al., 2007). It has been reported 

that  farmers  who  switch  from  conventional  to  organic  system  faced  critical  pest  or 

disease problems during a transition period of about 5 years but managed to control 

soil-borne diseases on the long-term (Bruggen and Termorshuizen, 2003). However, 

organic farmers generally faced more sanitary problems than conventional farmers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 66

 
 
III. 7. Handling and storage 
 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

Inappropriate manipulation of tubers at harvest or during storage can provoke 

wounds  that  increase  diseases  such  as  black  dot,  Fusarium  dry  rots,  silver  scurf, 

gangrene,  leak,  pink  rot,  black  leg  and  soft  rot  (Meredith  et  al.,  1975;  Hide,  1994; 

Vanvuurde and Devries, 1994; Salas et al., 2000; Marcinkowska et al., 2005; Peters 

et al., 2008b) (Table 1.8). Significant measures of managing potato diseases include: 

avoiding  mechanical  damage  to  potatoes  during  harvesting,  shipping  and  sorting, 

curing  the  harmed  parts  thereby  preventing  infection  and  disease  onset,  avoiding 

manipulation  of  cold  potato  since  potato  tubers  are  more  sensitive  to  injuries  when 

cold, avoiding the exposure of table potato to light, and continuously providing stored 

potatoes  with  fresh  air  (Milosevic  and  Alovic,  2006;  Scheid,  2006).  Most  of  the 

storage diseases decrease when the tubers are cured in dry conditions and stored at 

temperature below 4 or 5 °C, except gangrene (Table  1.8). However, tubers stored in 

a  dry  atmosphere  show  greater  weight  losses  than  tubers  stored  in  a  humid 

atmosphere, despite having less infection (Lennard, 1980). 

IV. Diseases management 
 

IV. 1.  Risk assessment and decision support systems 
 

Disease occurrence and development influenced by abiotic and biotic factors 

are  difficult  to  predict.  However,  their  prediction  would  be  very  useful  to  assess 

disease risk and consequently the potential yield loss and to choose the best disease 

control  strategy.  Current  methods  to  evaluate  yield  losses  are  based  on  predictive 

models which commonly assign a value or score to each risk factor, such as cultivar 

resistance,  inoculum  density,  cultural  practices  and  environmental  factors.  The 

maximum  score  that  can  be  assigned  to  each  factor  depends  on  the  relative 

importance of the factor in determining the disease. For example, cultivar resistance 

is considered to be a major determinant of powdery scab severity, so this factor has 

a  higher  score  than  the  zinc  content  of  soil,  which  is  thought  to  be  less  important 

(Burgess  and  Wale,  1994).  Assessment  of  the  risk  for  each  factor  and  for  each 

 

 

 

67

 
 
disease is performed by bioassays in fields or in growth chambers under controlled 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

conditions. They are generally costly, laborious and time consuming. 

Tolerant cultivars, that host pathogens without expressing symptoms, are a particular 

risk factor in potato production as they can maintain and increase the inoculum level 

in  fields  (Merz  and  Falloon,  2009).  A  tolerance  threshold  of  the  crop  has  to  be 

determined.  It  takes  into  account  the  relationship  between  inoculum  density  and 

disease incidence or severity according to cultivar resistance (Table 1.4). 

A score can also be attributed to each cultural practice in the equation of the model 

since they have various impacts on yield losses. For example, incidence and severity 

of Verticillium wilt decrease with long rotations (Johnston et al., 1994), but mint as a 

previous  crop  increases  Verticillium  wilt  (Omer  et  al.,  2008).  Consequently,  in  the 

equation  of  the  model,  rotation  length  will  be  negatively  correlated  to  yield  losses 

whereas  mint  as  previous  crop  will  be  positively  correlated  to  yield  losses  due  to 

Verticillium wilt. 

On  the  same  pattern,  some  predictable  environmental  factors  such  as  nutrient 

content  and  soil  pH  can  be  scored.  However,  abiotic  environmental  factors  are 

difficult to predict. For example, at planting time, rainfall and temperature conditions 

occurring at the critical growth phase of the disease are almost impossible to foresee. 

As climatic conditions cannot be predicted at middle term, models of risk assessment 

are less reliable. However, no factor alone has a dramatic effect on the disease; and 

the  beneficial  reduction  of  a  disease  is  usually  achieved  by  the  sum  of  optimized 

factors (Harrison, 1997).  

Mathematical  modelling  including  all  the  data  related  to  the  environmental  factors 

and to the results concerning plant resistance appeared to be helpful to evaluate risk, 

to  overcome  the  scaling  gap  between  bioassays  in  growth  chamber  and  field 

application  and  to  simulate  scenario  based  on  crop  management  (Janvier  et  al., 

Calculation of yield losses enables to identify a damage threshold and to determine 

the time at which disease control must be initiated. Indeed, yield loss threshold and 

economic threshold are different. Economic threshold is frequently higher than yield 

loss  threshold;  because  up  to  a  certain  point,  losing  yield  is  less  penalizing  for 

farmers than spending money to avoid it. Calculation of economic thresholds beyond 

which  control  of  diseases  is  profitable  takes  into  account  a  damage  function  drift  to 

2007).  

 68

 
 
potato  yield,  pathogen  population  density  and  crop  selling  prices.  For  example, 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

application  of  control  measures  is  found  to  be  beneficial  at  an  initial  density  of  G. 
rostochiensis higher than 8 eggs and larvae g-1 soil, while the damage threshold is at 
2  eggs  g-1  soil  (Samaliev  and  Andreev,  1998).  Economic  thresholds  allow  taking 

short-term strategic decisions such as choice of the cultivar, cultural practices, timing 

of  crop  establishment,  seed  treatment,  planting  density  etc.  and  long-term  strategic 

decisions  such  as  define  research  priorities,  design  the  breeding  programs  or 

develop  integrated  pest  management  strategies  (Savary  et  al.,  2006)  (Figure  1.2). 

Predicting  models  are  used  by  farmers  as  decision  support  systems  (DSS)  and 

generally provide a theoretical yield to be obtained at the end of the cropping period, 

a monitoring of pest populations and comments and advices in order to increase the 

theoretical  yield  as  much  as  possible  (Been  et  al.,  2005;  Jorg  et  al.,  2006).  Some 

DSS  are  able  to  send  real  time  alerts  to  farmers  when  several  risk  factors  are 

combined  and  when  control  measures  have  to  be  taken  immediately  (Dubois  and 

Duvauchelle,  2004).  DSS  are  environmental  and  farmer  friendly  as  they  enable  to 

increase economical yields by applying the right chemical doses at the right time and 

when  disease  pressure  requires  it,  in  order  to  reduce  unnecessary  environmental 

pollutions and treatment cost.

IV. 2.  Control methods 
 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

Ways to control diseases are evolving since the use of chemicals is supposed to 

be  reduced. In many  cases, the  most efficient  long-term  strategy  is  to use  resistant 

cultivars  when  available.  Otherwise,  management  strategies  consist  either  in 

exclusion, avoiding contact between plant and pathogens, or by pest eradication, and 

leading to complete elimination or partial reduction of pathogen populations.  

For the potato crop which is multiplied vegetatively, exclusion methods begin with the 

use of healthy tubers. Many soil-borne pathogens can be carried on by seed tubers 

and  the  use  of  certified  seed  potatoes  is  a  major  way  to  control  or  restrict  the 

movement  of  pathogens  of  potato  crops  (Andrade  et  al.,  2008).  Seed  certification 

programs  aim  at  warranting  seed  tuber  quality  to  potato  producers  and  favour  the 

diffusion of genetic progress. The certified seed production process may be 8 to 10 

years long. Strict rules established by the national regulation institutions (i.e. National 

Potato Council in USA or GNIS - SOC (Groupement national interprofessionnel des 

semences  -  Service  officiel  de  contrôle)  in  France)  have  to  be  respected  and  the 

seeds  are  regularly  inspected  for  bacterial,  viral,  and  fungal  diseases,  as  well  as 

varietal  purity  and  identity.  Each  country  is  free  to  apply  more  or  less  severe  rules. 

Certification systems have been developed in most of the seed producing countries 

to  cover  the  production  of  certified  seed  potatoes  free  from  pathogens  and  pests 

(McDonald,  1995;  Grousset  and  Smith,  1998;  Sahajdak  and  Uznanska,  2003).  An 

international project of commercial and phytosanitary minimal guidelines (CEE-ONU 

S-1) is in progress. It is intended to serve as a minimal base consensus between the 

various standards established at "regional" levels (EU, NATTO, etc) (UNECE). 

Eradication  strategies  aim  at  eliminating  an  established  pathogen  from  plant 

propagation  material  or  production  sites.  Eradication  methods  involve  the  use  of 

pesticides,  adapted  cultural  practices  or  biological  control.  Application  of  fungicides 

and  nematicides  are  protecting  strategies  (see  section  III.  5.  and  table  1.8)  whose 

application  time  and  doses  can  be  advised  by  DSS.  However,  pesticides  are 

sometimes  inefficient  against  pathogens,  such  as  P.  carotovorum  (Latour  et  al., 

2008), or their use is limited by environmental regulations. Consequently, alternative 

methods based on adapted cultural practices have to be recommended (see section 

III and tables 1.3 and 1.8). Some crops either susceptible or resistant may serve as 

baiting-crop,  for  example,  resistant  potato  cultivars  cropped  just  before  the  main 

 70

 
 
potato  crop  decreased  black  scurf  (Scholte, 2000).  Likewise,  alfalfa  can  be  used  to 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

avoid TRV transmitted by stubby root nematode, as this crop is a host for stubby-root 

nematode  but  immune  to  TRV  (Stevenson  et  al.,  2001).  Cultivar  precocity  can  be 

used to avoid some diseases. Since black dot and charcoal rot damages occur late in 

the  growing  season,  early  cultivars  are  generally  recommended  to  control  these 

diseases  (Stevenson  et  al.,  2001).  When  a  disease  is  established  in  a  production 

site, its spread must be avoided as much as possible. All diseased plants have to be 

eliminated or burned and tools should be properly disinfected before use in another 

field (Salas et al., 2000; Latour et al., 2008).  

Natural  interactions  of  plants  and  microorganisms  with  the  pathogens  are  used  as 

biological control to protect potato crops. There is a continuum from a conducive soil 

to a suppressive one (Alabouvette et al., 1996) what means that in each soil, almost 

each  pathogen  can  be  potentially  controlled  by  other  microorganisms  either  by  a 

specific antagonism or by competition with total microbial biomass (see section II. 2. 

and table 1.6). Appropriate agricultural practices, thanks to the DSS should stimulate 

this potential to enhance or to maintain the soil suppressiveness to potato diseases.  

Another  approach  consists  in  applying  biocontrol  agents.  However,  the  choice  of  a 

biological  control  agent  must  take  into  account  the  potential  risks  to  human  health. 

Even if Serratia grimesii and Burkholderia cepacia decrease dry rot and black scurf 

and  stem  canker  respectively,  they  can  cause  human  infections  and  are  not 

recommended  for  biological  control  (Table  1.6)  (Grosch  et  al.,  2005;  Gould  et  al., 

2008).  Moreover,  indirect  control  such  as  strengthening  of  potato  plants  by 

mycorhization  increases  tuber  yield  and  allow  an  integrated  management  of  potato 

cyst nematode and root-knot nematode (Sankaranarayanan and Sundarababu, 2001; 

Ryan  et  al.,  2003).  Biological  control  may  also  include  the  use  of  natural  toxic 

compounds  for  pathogenic  agents.  Fumigation  of  essential  oils  is  studied  to  control 

dry  rot,  gangrene,  black  scurf  and  stem  canker  (Bang,  2007).  Fish  emulsion  and 

crushed  crab  shell  are  used  against  V.  dahliae,  V.  albo-atrum  and  S.  endobioticum 

respectively  (Hampson  and  Coombes,  1995;  Abbasi  et  al.,  2006).  Soil  can  be 

disinfected  from  pathogens  by  biofumigation  or  solar  heating  or  both.  For  example, 

Brassica crops used in crop rotations and as green manures have been associated 

with  reductions  in  soil-borne  pests  and  pathogens.  These  reductions  have  been 

attributed  to  the  production  of  volatile  sulfur  compounds  through  the  process  of 

 

71

 
 
biofumigation,  and  to  changes  in  soil  microbial  community  structure  (Janvier  et  al., 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

2007).  Composting  is  also  a  sanitizing  method  which  combines  temperature,  time 

and toxic compounds to control potato diseases. The composts the most frequently 

used  on  potato  crop  are  organic  wastes  (sludge,  manure,  tea,  etc.)  that  have 

undergone  long,  thermophilic,  aerobic  decomposition.  The  most  effective  compost 

composition  and  combinations  of  temperature  and  time  have  to  be  determined  for 

each  pathogen.  As  it  decreases  the  pathogenic  population  or  favours  microbial 

enrichment  of  the  soil,  compost  has  generally  a  positive  or  no  effect  on  disease 

suppression,  and  only  rarely  a  disease  stimulating  effect  (Termorshuizen  et  al., 

2006). Sanitization is also performed on tubers before planting by hot water (Janvier 

et al., 2007) or during storage with chemical treatments at high temperatures (Secor 

et  al.,  1988).  However,  heating  may  damage  tubers  resulting  in  fewer  sprouts. 

Biocontrol  can  also  be  performed  by  disrupting  pathogens  molecular  pathways.  P. 

carotovorum  quorum-sensing  mechanism  is  controlled  by  a  quorum-quenching 

strategy  aiming  at  interrupting  the  quorum-sensing  by  using  compounds  or 

organisms  able  to  cause  interferences  in  the  bacterial  signal  (Latour  et  al.,  2008). 

Finally,  it  is  also  possible  to  enhance  plant  defence  reactions  against  soil-borne 

pathogens  by  foliar  spraying  with  different  inducers  such  as  salicylic  acid,  di-

potassium hydrogen phosphate and tri-potassium phosphate (Mahmoud, 2007). 

The different methods that were presented above are not items that have to be taken 

at random. Their combination generally gives better results than each of the method 

applied alone.  

Decision  support  systems  developed  to  predict  yield  losses  allow  choosing  good 

control  methods  such  as  the  use  of  healthy  seeds,  adapted  pesticides,  cultural 

practices and biological control agents for each potato diseases. 

Conclusions 
 

If a disease results from the interaction between the plant and a pathogen, its 

severity  is  influenced  by  soil  abiotic  and  biotic  factors  affecting  the  plant,  the 

pathogen,  or  both  (Alabouvette  et  al.,  1996).  Biotic  and  abiotic  factors  are  not 

independent,  the  abiotic  factors  modulating  the  biotic  ones.  They  act  both  on  the 

disease  epidemiology,  that  means  the  environmental  conditions  which  make  the 

 

 

 72

 
 
plant  growing  and  the  pathogen,  present  or  latent  on  the  crop,  causing  or  not  the 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

disease. Moreover, some unfavourable factors for a given disease can be favourable 

to  another.  The  multifaceted  interactions  between  plants,  pathogens  and  their 

environment  make  disease  management  complex  since  controlling  every  factor 

occurring in the disease development is quite impossible. Potato producers have to 

aim  at  limiting  contact  between  plant  and  pathogens  by  using  for  example  healthy 

seeds.  Moreover,  pathosystems  are  continuously  changing  since  the  pathogens 

genetically  adapt  to  their  hosts  or  to  the  environmental  conditions  implemented  by 

human activities or not. In a system whose parameters vary continuously, the control 

strategies have to be adapted to each situation at every time.  

This review aimed at being as exhaustive as possible about the factors impacting the 

occurrence  and  development  of  the  soil-borne  potato  diseases.  To  our  knowledge, 

such  a  work  putting  in  relation  numerous  potato  diseases  and  comparing  their 

development  conditions,  the  ecology  of  the  causal  pathogens  and  their  abiotic  and 

biotic  interactions  responds  to  a  clear  demand  from  both  scientists,  extension 

services,  breeders,  and  farmers.  Studies  dealing  with  potato  diseases  frequently 

consider only one or few diseases at the same time. Thus, this review constitutes by 

itself  a  decision  support  system  since 

the  optimal 

factors 

limiting  disease 

development  are  listed.  Nevertheless,  the  data  collected  here  deal  more  with 

diseases  known  in  developed  counties  and  those  which  cause  severe  economical 

losses. Knowledge about minor diseases such as Phoma leaf spot, Rosellinia black 

rot and Thecaphora smut are extremely rare, probably because these diseases occur 

in  very  isolated  areas.  Phoma  leaf  spot  was  recorded  only  in  Bolivia  and  Peru, 

Rosellinia black rot was described in South America and Africa and Thecaphora smut 

in South America and Mexico.  

Moreover,  soil-borne  diseases  are  difficult  to  study  because  soil  is  a  complex 

environment in which numerous interactions occur and where detection of pathogens 

is not easily performed. However, researches on those diseases could be beneficial 

at  long-term  in  case  they  would  spread  throughout  the  world.  It  would  have  been 

rather  complex  to  consider  air-borne  diseases  in  addition  to  soil-borne  diseases  of 

potato.  However,  air-borne  diseases  such  as  late  blight  caused  by  Phytophthora 

infestans  and  early  blight  caused  by  Alternaria  solani  are  responsible  for  huge 

economical  losses  and  have  to  be  considered  with  as  much  attention  as  soil-borne 

 

73

 
 
diseases.  Finally,  since  few  years,  importance  of  potato  tuber  quality  raised  in 

Chapter 1 – Potato soil-borne diseases 

developed countries where tubers are washed before selling. Indeed, washing tuber 

makes  visible  some  superficial  blemishes  that  were  previously  hidden  by  adhering 

soil. Consumer's habits changing, blemished tubers cannot be sold anymore and the 

losses take seriously damaging proportions for potato market. 

The previous considerations acknowledge the fact that the plant disease problem can 

be reduced in short term thanks to solid knowledge in epidemiology and pathogens 

ecology,  but  in  longer  term  control  strategies  must  be  adapted  with  the  constant 

evolution of pathosystems.

Abstract 

 

 

Since most of ware potato tubers are washed before selling, tubers blemishes are an 

important cause for downgrading and rejection of tuber lots. Tubers may be affected 

by  a  diversity  of  superficial  blemishes  among  which  typical  and  atypical  blemishes 

can  be  distinguished.  Typical  blemishes  are  those  for  which  the  causal  agents  are 

known.  They  are  more  studied  than  atypical  blemishes for  which  the  causal  agents 

are  still  unknown,  sometimes  putative  and  not  yet  scientifically 

identified. 

Researchers,  growers  and  technical  staff  dealing  with  such  blemishes  all  over  the 

world  use  different  terminologies  to  describe  each  of  the  blemishes.  Besides  major 

tuber  diseases  like  silver  scurf,  black  dot  and  powdery  scab,  for  which  common 

names of symptoms are usually well defined and consensual, there is a wide range 

of  atypical  blemishes  and  some  typical  ones  for  which  the  terminology  is  more 

disparate  and  may 

induce  confusion  and  misunderstandings.  Physiological 

mechanisms  involved  in  the  appearance  of  atypical  blemishes  are  reviewed;  this 

highlights the scarcity of available data on the subject and the need for carrying out 

complementary  studies  based  on  a  consensual  nomenclature.  After  a  critical 

worldwide  bibliographical  review  of  the  most  commonly  used  terminology  of  tuber 

blemishes, we put forward a proposal for a new nomenclature harmonizing common 

names for each kind of blemish.  

 78

Chapter 2 – Nomenclature and classification of potato blemishes 

Introduction 

 

Since  several  decades  potato  (Solanum  tuberosum  L.)  crop  area  increases 

especially  in  developing  countries.  Some  325  millions  tons  of  tubers  are  produced 

annually  in  the  world  (FAO,  2008).  In  western  Europe,  most  fresh  potato  lots  are 

washed before selling (Commission of the European Communities, 2007): this radical 

procedure  has  positively  prevented  a  too  harsh  decline  of  the  consumption  of  table 

potatoes  but  has  had  an  adverse  effect  of  highlighting  tuber  skin  defects.  As  a 

consequence, visual quality of tubers has become a very important cause of rejection 

or  downgrading  of  potatoes  leading  to  potential  important  economical  losses  for 

farmers.  

Potato tubers are subjected to a very large range of blemishes, which generally affect 

only  upper  layers  of  the  tuber  periderm  and  do  not  damage  the  inner  part  nor  the 

nutritional quality of the potatoes. On one hand, typical blemishes are those that are 

largely studied and which have usually known causal origins, for example, common 

scab,  netted  scab,  powdery  scab,  black  scurf,  black  dot  and  silver  scurf  that  are 

caused  by  thoroughly  identified  bacteria  or  fungi.  Consequently  the  symptom 

terminology  is  consensual  though  with  the  exception  for  potato  scabs  (common, 

netted scab and russet scab). On the other hand, atypical blemishes, because still of 

unknown  origin,  might  be  frequently  observed  but  they  have  been  very  rarely 

investigated  (Perraton,  personal  data,  1996  and  Campion  et  al.,  2003).  Since  ware 

tubers  are  washed  in  order  to  remove  adherent  soil,  there  has  been  a  constant 

feedback  from  growers  and  packers  about  a  number  of  skin  defects  which  do  not 

appear to be associated with any of the typical blemishes, but which lead as likely to 

rejections  or  downgrading.  These  atypical  blemishes  are  distributed  on  the  tuber 

surface as more or less big patches of various aspects: shallow, irregular, and scaly, 

crackled or rough (Jouan, 1997; Stevenson et al., 2001; Sexton, 2003; Selman et al., 

2008).  

Literature  shows  that  terminologies  concerning  atypical  blemishes  as  well  as  some 

typical blemishes like potato scabs differ according to the aspect of the blemish and 

the  country  where  they  are  observed.  It  also  appears  that  atypical  blemishes  are 

sometimes  falsely  attributed  to  pathogens  causing  other  similar  blemishes.  Since 

several  years,  these  issues  are  discussed  among  researchers  and  end-users;  they 

highlight  a  lack  of  knowledge  on  the  biology  and  symptomatology  of  those  potato 

 

79

blemishes.  Thus,  the  establishment  of  a  consensual  classification  nomenclature  of 

blemishes  for  all  the  scientific  community  is  a  prerequisite  for  further  scientific 

investigation. At first, this paper briefly reviews the disorders leading to the alteration 

of  the  periderm.  Then,  based  on  the  literature,  as  well  as  shared  experience  on 

assessment  of  tuber  blemishes  in  collaborative  research  (Fiers  et  al.,  2010)  and 

extension  projects  (FNPPPT  et  al.,  2008),  it  suggests  a  consensual  nomenclature 

describing  the  main  superficial  blemishes,  with  special  emphasis  on  the  atypical 

blemishes of potato tubers. 

Physiological disorders involved in the formation of atypical blemishes 

The  mechanisms  underlying  the  appearance  of  the  blemishes  are  not  well 

known,  but  the  most  important  lack  of  knowledge  concerns  the  atypical  blemishes. 

The  formation  of  atypical  blemishes  on  the  potato  surface  implies  histological 

modifications  and  cellular  disorders  as  a  result  of  the  plant  response  to  an  attack.  

Atypical  corky  blemishes  forming  polygonal  lesions  (Figure  2.1.A)  appear  to  be  the 

result  of  one  part  of  the  tuber  surface  not  growing  as  fast  as  the  rest  of  the  tuber 

(Sexton,  2003).  These  polygonal  lesions  may  be  due  to  localized  stress  that  only 

affects  one  area  of  the  tuber,  while  the  rest  of  the  tuber  continues  to  grow  and 

expand normally. They may occur when a stress uniformly slows down the growth of 

the  whole  tuber,  but  after  the  stress  ends,  the  resumption  of  growth  is  not  uniform 

across the tuber. If one area of the tuber surface fails to recover from the stress as 

fast  as  the  rest  of  the  tuber,  it  will  grow  slower  than  the  surrounding  tissues.  If  the 

tuber does  not  have  a  mechanism  to  respond  to  that  stress, then polygonal  lesions 

could  develop  within  the  tuber  structure.  Several  authors  suggest  that  polygonal 

lesions could be due to unfavourable environmental conditions, i.e high temperature, 

high organic matter content, high soil moisture or fertilization (Stevenson et al., 2001; 

Turff,  2002;  Selman  et  al.,  2008).  The  fungus  R.  solani  was  cited  as  well  as 

responsible for the formation of polygonal lesions. The fungus growing on the tuber 

surface  would  delay  the  growth  of  the  underlying  tissues,  which  may  result  in 

deformed  tubers.  The  pattern  of  the  lesions  on  the  skin  would  be  related  to  the 

pattern  of  the  branching  hyphae  of  the  fungus.  Some  of  these  hyphae  may  still  be 

present on newly harvested tubers (Mulder et al., 2008).

Chapter 2 – Nomenclature and classification of potato blemishes 

Corky  cracks  and  tuber  cracks  (Figures  2.1.G  and  2.1.R)  are  also  quoted  as 

physiological reactions to a growth stress, either abiotic (fluctuation of soil moisture, 

herbicide) or biotic (disease, e.g., R. solani etc.). The main cause of tuber cracks is 

an irregular water uptake during the growing season. During a period of drought, the 

tuber stops growing. A water uptake induces a rapid rehydratation of the tuber. The 

internal  turgor  pressure  becomes  stronger  than  the  peridermal  resistance.  The 

periderm  breaks  and  heals  progressively  afterwards  (Stevenson  et  al.,  2001; 

FNPPPT et al., 2008).  

Dry core blemish (Figure 2.1.S) is almost always allocated to R. solani, but it seems 

that the blemish only appears when the tuber is mechanically or naturally wounded. 

Wireworms  might  be  the  main  cause  of  natural  wounding  making  fungal  invasion 

easier (Keiser, 2007). 

It is likely that an unclear identification associated to a fuzzy terminology may explain 

the  lack  of  publications  about  the  mechanisms  inducing  corky  spots  and  star-like 

lesions (Figures 2.1.H to 2.1.J). 

The  majority  of  atypical  blemishes  affect  the  periderm  integrity.  Some  of  these 

blemishes,  such  as  polygonal  lesions,  corky  cracks  or  dry  core  are  similar  to  the 

scars observed on tuber after they have been wounded. Tuber wound responses and 

wound-healing involve many biological processes, the most important of which being 

wound-induced  suberization.  The  tissue  distribution  of  suberized  cell  walls  in  plant 

suggests that suberization occurs wherever and whenever the plant needs to form a 

physical barrier (Franke and Schreiber, 2007; Pollard et al., 2008). As the wounded 

tuber  tissue  begins  to  heal,  it  forms  a  closing  layer  where  the  walls  of  existing 

parenchyma cells become suberized. In conjunction with the formation of the closing 

layer,  a  wound  periderm  forms  under  the  closing  layer  (Lulai,  2007).  The  similarity 

between corky blemish and healed wound suggests that similar cellular mechanisms 

are  induced  by  plants.  Wounding,  stress  and/or  invasion  of  plant  tissues  by 

pathogens  elicit  an  oxidative  burst  of  superoxide,  hydrogen  peroxide  and  hydroxyl 

radicals at the wound surface. These reactive oxygen forms play a role in protecting 

host tissue. Wounding activates superoxide radical formation that may have a role in 

the  suberin  synthesis  (Kumar  et  al.,  2007).  In  addition  to  this  putative  role  i.e. 

polymerization of phenolic monomers in lignin/suberin synthesis, the reactive oxygen 

forms  serve  as  (a)  signaling  molecules  for  upregulating  defence-related  genes,  (b) 

anti-microbial  agents  and  catalysts  for  cross-linking  cell  wall  proteins,  and  (c) 

 

81

Chapter 2 – Nomenclature and classification of potato blemishes 

molecules  triggering  hypersensitive  cell  death  to  contain  infection  (Levine  et  al., 

1994; Simon-Plas et al., 2002; Kumar et al., 2007).  

Data about physiological processes resulting in atypical blemishes are rare however 

the  understanding  of  these  processes  is  needed  to  control  tuber  superficial 

alterations.  Doubtless,  the  first  step  toward  a  full  comprehension  of  these 

mechanisms  is  to  remedy  the  confusing  terminology  of  blemishes  and  to  clearly 

identify, describe and name typical and atypical blemishes. 

Critical  analysis  of  current  terminology  for  superficial  blemishes  on  potato 

Morphological descriptions and pictures of blemishes have been published in 

several  books  and  guides  (Radtke  and  Rieckmann,  1991;  Stevenson  et  al.,  2001; 

FNPPPT et al., 2008; Mulder et al., 2008; Wale et al., 2008). However depending on 

the  authors,  common  names  and  descriptions  of  the  blemishes  differ.  This  induces 

ambiguities  and  misunderstandings  between  the  different  actors  along  the  potato 

production chain whether they are scientists or extension workers (Table 2.1). 

We  firstly  review  typical  blemishes,  whose  causes  are  known,  and  whose 

terminologies  are  straightforward.  Albeit,  they  have  been  fully  described  in  the 

literature,  in  practice  they  may  be  confused  one  with  the  others  because  of  the 

similarity of symptoms. As an example, black dot caused by Colletotrichum coccodes 

(Figure 2.1.A) and silver scurf caused by Helminthosporium solani (Figure 2.1.B) may 

be  misinterpreted  by  inexperienced  eye  because  of  the  similarity  of  the  discoloured 

patches they form on tuber surface. Black dot causes diffuse grey-brown spots with 

black microsclerotia, whereas silver scurf blemishes are clear silvery spots with very 

fine  black  punctuations  and  induce  a  separation  of  the  periderm  (El  Imane-Collet, 

1993;  Stevenson  et  al.,  2001).  Inspection  with  a  hand  lens  (10  x)  will  quickly 

differentiate the regularly spaced black dots from the bunched threads of silver scurf. 

Though  dealing  with  a  pathosystem  thoroughly  studied  (Merz  and  Falloon,  2009), 

one  may  still  mistakes  between  some  types  of  powdery  scab  lesions  caused  by 

Spongospora subterranea (Figure 2.1.M) and some common scab symptoms caused 

 

 

 

tubers

Chapter 2 – Nomenclature and classification of potato blemishes 

by  some  strains  of Streptomyces  (Figures  2.1.N,  2.1.O, 2.1.P)  simply  because they 

produce visually similar puffy pustules (Jouan, 1997).  

Secondly, typical blemishes, whose causes are known, but whose terminologies are 

unclear are considered. The confusion may come from the different common names 

used  for  the  same  typical  blemish  or  from  the  same  name  used  for  different 

blemishes. Diseases caused by Streptomyces spp. are the most striking example. In 

Europe,  and  especially  in  France,  the  term  common  scab  refers  to  at  least  two 

different diseases caused by Streptomyces spp. (Table 2.2): i) raised scab, a raised 

blemish sometimes looking like craters on tuber surface (Figure 2.1.O), and ii) netted 

scab,  a  symptom  forming  corky  network  (Figure  2.1.D)  (Bouchek-Mechiche  et  al., 

2000b). Netted scab was only described in European countries. In North America or 

Asia,  the  term  common  scab  describes  one  disease  including  several  types  of 

lesions.  They  are  round  to  star-shaped,  clearly  defined  corky  lesions  called  pitted 

scab  (Figure  2.1.N),  raised  or  erumpent  scab  (Figure  2.1.O)  and  shallow  scab 

(Figure 2.1.P) (Goyer et al., 1996; Takeuchi et al., 1996; Wanner and Haynes, 2009). 

Russet scab (Figure 2.1.E) has only been described in the USA (Loria et al., 1997), 

in Japan (Oniki et al., 1986), in Canada (Faucher et al., 1993), in India (Khanna et al., 

2000) and in Finlande (Kreuze et al., 1999). Russet scab and netted scab are visually 

very similar blemishes, which can be sometimes considered as one unique blemish 

(Natsume  et  al.,  2005).  However,  netted  scab  tends  to  form  a  network  at  the  tuber 

surface, while russet scab does not. Moreover, russet scab and netted scab differ in 

several  characteristics  such  as  cultivar  susceptibility,  root  attack,  and  optimum  soil 

temperature  and  are,  therefore,  considered  being  different  diseases  caused  by 

different  Streptomyces  species  (Loria  et  al.,  1997;  Kreuze  et  al.,  1999;  Bouchek-

Mechiche et al., 2000b). The different kinds of potato scabs are caused by different 

species  of  the  Streptomyces  genus.  S.  scabies,  S.  europaeiscabiei,  S.  stelliscabiei, 

S. acidiscabiei, S. turguidiscabiei, and maybe some others cause common or pitted 

scab  (Stevenson  et  al.,  2001;  Mulder  et  al.,  2008);  S.  reticuliscabiei  and  some 

isolates of S. europaeiscabiei cause netted scab (Bouchek-Mechiche et al., 2000a), 

and some isolates belonging to S. aureofaciens group cause russet scab (Faucher et 

al., 1993; Kreuze et al., 1999).

Likewise,  tubers  may  present  different  types  of  superficial  rugosity  which  are 

described  by  very  diverse  terms.  A  rough  or  scaled  periderm  of  the  tuber  might  be 

referred  as  a  blemish  called  rough  russeted  skin  or  russeting  (Figure  2.1.K).  This 

blemish is a genetic varietal characteristic (eg. cultivar Russet Burbank), even though 

some authors suggest that physiological causes could also intervene (Okazawa and 

Iriuda, 1980; Jong, 1981). Russeting differs from russet scab as it forms deeper and 

larger  network  on  potato  tubers.  Another  similar  blemish  induces  a  scuffed  or 

feathered  appearance  of  the  tuber  with  a  rubbed  off  periderm,  called  scuffing, 

skinning,  excoriation  or  skin-set  (Figure  2.1.L).  This  blemish  is  allocated  to 

physiological or mechanical injury (Stevenson et al., 2001; Lulai, 2007). 

Thirdly,  we  focus  on  atypical  blemishes,  whose  causes  are  unknown,  and  whose 

terminologies  unclear.  They  are  often  allocated  to  typical  blemishes,  although  the 

symptoms  are  not  exactly  identical  and  the  causes  are  not  clearly  demonstrated 

through the fulfilment of Koch’s postulates. Atypical blemishes include several kinds 

of blemish which often have corky appearance (Figures 2.1.F to 2.1.J) and, to some 

degree,  are  visually  similar  to  the  ones  due  to  known  pathogens,  namely 

Streptomyces spp. or R. solani. This is particularly true for netted scab-like blemishes 

(Figure 2.1.F and 2.1.H). The most common names encountered in North-American 

publications are elephant hide or alligator hide – for russet-skinned cultivars, or fishy 

skin, fish scale, and turtleback – for smooth-skinned cultivars (Hart, 1971; Stevenson 

et  al.,  2001;  Turff,  2002;  Selman  et  al.,  2008)  (Table  2.1).  More  descriptive  names 

are  used  in  Europe  to  describe  these  atypical  corky  blemishes,  like  cork, 

desquamation, scurfy appearance or scabby lesions (Campion et al., 2003; FNPPPT 

 86

Chapter 2 - Nomenclature and classification of potato blemishes 

et al., 2008). In some instances, these corky blemishes have sometimes been called 

rhizoscab because the occurrence of these atypical blemishes was suspected to be 

connected with R. solani (Jouan, 1997). Indeed, such symptoms are compared to the 

ones observed with tuber deformations and cracks (Figure 2.1.G) (Stevenson et al., 

2001).  However,  the  implication  of  R  solani  has  so  far  never  been  clearly 

demonstrated (Turff, 2002; Campion et al., 2003).  

In  Europe,  R.  solani  is  also  frequently  associated  with  the  occurrence  of  dry  cores 

(Figure 2.1.S), which are restricted brown cavities up to several millimetres deep with 

a diameter of 3 to 6 millimetres (Radtke and Rieckmann, 1991; Keiser, 2007; Wale et 

al., 2008). Still this blemish is not mentioned in the American compendium of potato 

diseases (2001). In addition, several other atypical blemishes are often mentioned by 

farmers and extension workers dealing with thin-skinned potato cultivars grown under 

irrigation schemes; theses blemishes have the appearance of scurfy tissues around 

the lenticels (Figure 2.1.C). This blemish called enlarged lenticels is known to be due 

to  excessive  moisture  or  insufficient  supply  of  oxygen.  However,  it  is  sometimes 

allocated to R. solani or Streptomyces spp. because enlarged lenticels may resemble 

scab lesions, although they are smaller and lighter in colour (Stevenson et al., 2001). 

Another interesting study case is the scab-like pale brown lesion with or without star-

shaped  cracks  (Figure  2.1.J)  which  is  attributed  to  tobacco  necrosis  virus  (TNV) 

(Mulder  et  al.,  2008)  whereas  TNV  tuber  symptomatology  has  been  illustrated  by 

other authors (Radtke and Rieckmann, 1991; Jeffries, 1998) as being quite differently 

looking and whereas other authors have isolated, from such identical blemishes, R. 

solani  from  the  fifth  anastomosis  group  (Perraton,  personal  data,  1997).  Moreover 

such  blemishes  can  easily  be  confused  with  several  types  of  scab  caused  by 

Streptomyces spp. At this point and because no complete Koch’s postulate has been 

scientifically fulfilled, it is impossible to draw any conclusion about the causing agent 

whether it is TNV or R. solani or Streptomyces spp.  

Further  more,  in  recently  published  potato  disease  guide  (Mulder  et  al.,  2008), 

atypical corky blemish called polygonal lesion (Figure 2.1.G) has been attributed as a 

consequence  of  Armillaria  species  infection  :  very  few  data  are  available  about  this 

pathosystem (Jones and MacLeod, 1937) and the fulfilment of Koch’s postulate has 

probably never be attempted. By all means, this type of superficial blemish could be 

the result of any soil-borne microorganism, whether it is bacterial or fungal.

Chapter 2 - Nomenclature and classification of potato blemishes 

This  survey  about  current  terms  used  for  designation  of  some  typical  and  atypical 

blemishes  highlights  confusing  situations  and  an  obvious  need  of  clarification.  The 

following  paragraph  will  endeavour 

to  give  a  clearer  and  more  structured 

nomenclature for classification of potato tuber blemishes. 

Proposal of a nomenclature for potato blemishes 

In  order  to  resolve  the  nomenclatural  problems  about  the  common  names  of 

typical  and  atypical  blemishes  on  potato  tubers,  we  suggest  the  nomenclature 

hereafter,  based  on  the  visual  aspect  of  blemishes  rather  than  on  their  typical  or 

atypical  character.  According  to  the  naked-eye  visual  aspect,  we  can  establish  two 

categories of blemishes: the superficial blemishes and the raised ones (Table 2.3).

flesh. They include: 

1.  Superficial  blemishes  alter  only  the  external  layers  of  the  periderm  and 

occasionally the external cortical cells but they never deeply damage the tuber 

-  Discoloration  such  as  black  dot  and  silver  scurf  lesions,  which  form 

discoloured spots on the tuber surface (Figures 2.1.A and 2.1.B).  

-  Corky blemish such as   

o  Enlarged  lenticel,  small,  initially  white  turning  brown,  corky  lesion 

surrounding the lenticels, that are clearly described (Figure 2.1.C). 

o  Netted scab (produced by Streptomyces spp.) which forms typical, 

very superficial and regular polygonal corky lesions (Figure 2.1.D) 

o  Russet  scab  (produced  by  strains  belonging  to  S.  aureofasciens 

group),  which  is  very  similar  to  netted  scab,  with  different 

conditions of development (Figure 2.1.E) 

o  Atypical  corky  blemish  (unknown  origin)  that  can  appear  under 

different forms, we suggest to distinguish 4 categories:  

(cid:1)  Elephant  hide,  turtleback  or  scabby  lesion  (Figure  2.1.F), 

characterized  by  the  polygonal  framework  it  forms  on  the 

tuber periderm. We suggest using the term polygonal lesion 

(cid:1)  Corky  crack  (Figure  2.1.G)  refers  to  corky  lesions  present 

to describe this blemish. 

on split tubers; 

(cid:1)  Corky  spot,  formerly  named  rhizoscab  (Figure  2.1.H),  is 

similar  to  polygonal  lesions,  but  forms  little  corky  patch 

instead  of  large  corky  plates.  The  term  rhizoscab  should 

not  be  employed  henceforth  because  it  suggests  that  R. 

solani  might  be  responsible  for  this  blemish,  even  though 

the Koch's postulates have so far never been fulfilled; 

(cid:1)  Star-like corky lesion with or without halo (Figures 2.1.I and 

2.1.J); 

-  Rugosity including  

(Figure 2.1.K),  

o  russeting, which refers to a rough or scaled periderm of the tuber 

o  skinning,  which  describes  the  blemish  quite  similar  to  russeting 

but forming a detached periderm (Figure 2.1.L).  

 90

Chapter 2 - Nomenclature and classification of potato blemishes 

2.  Pitted  or  raised  blemish  form  recessing  or  projecting  skin  piece  masses  on 

the tuber (Table 2.3). They include:  

-  Pustules resulting from either  

o  powdery  scab,  which  forms  pustules  releasing  a  brownish  and 

powdery mass consisting of cytosori at maturity (Figure 2.1.M) or 

o  common  scab.  We  suggest 

that 

the 

international  scientific 

community  should  henceforth  use  the  term  common  scab  to 

describe pitted, raised or shallow lesions caused by Streptomyces 

bacteria.  The  general  term  common  scab  used  in  Europe,  and 

referring either to netted scab or (raised) common scab, should be 

replaced  by  the  term  potato  scabs  (Table  2.2).  Three  different 

kinds of common scab blemishes can be distinguished:  

(cid:1)  pitted  scab  (Figure  2.1.N)  is  commonly  used  to  describe 

those  deep,  sometimes  star-shaped  lesions  and  the  term 

(cid:1) 

raised scab (Figure 2.1.O) instead of erumpent scab, which 

should be conserved; 

is less frequently used; 

(cid:1)  shallow  scab  (Figure  2.1.P)  instead  of  superficial  scab 

which is a too general term.  

-  Sclerotia  or  black  scurf,  typical  potato  blemish  appearing  as  black 

superficial  and  irregularly  shaped  raised  lumps,  resting  pellets  of  R. 

solani mycelia tightly attached to the periderm (Figure 2.1.Q). 

-  Tuber crack (Figure 2.1.R) being shallow to moderately deep splits of the 

tuber and for which this general term can be kept to describe all the kind 

of cracks without suggesting their origin or their cause.  

-  Dry  core  (Figure  2.1.S),  a  brown  deep  lesion  for  which  terminology  is 

commonly accepted. 

The  suggested  nomenclature  aims  at  harmonising  the  terms  used  to  describe 

the  different  blemishes  of  potato  tubers  and  could  help  avoiding  several 

mistakes that can be made in the fields when blemished tubers are observed.

Conclusion 

As  the  globalisation  extends  and  because  more  and  more  multinational 

research projects are set up, there is a need for harmonising the terminology for 

scientific  community  and  to  make  sure  that  we  talk  the  same  language  about 

potato blemishes. Scientific papers often focus on a single disease with one or 

several  symptoms,  whereas  pluridisciplinary  approaches  are  les  frequent. 

Underlined is the problem of dealing with the potato overall pathosystems and 

more  precisely 

the  soil-borne  pathosystems.  By  suggesting  a  detailed 

transversal view of potato blemish issue, this paper intends to make closer the 

points of view of scientific researchers and of more generalist persons dealing 

with potatoes such as growers, breeders, seed certification staff, etc. Reviewing 

the literature on this subject, it was obvious that a clarification of the terminology 

was necessary. This nomenclature is based on the study of the different terms 

used in the world to describe main potato blemishes. The terms the most widely 

employed  and  the  richest  in  sense  for  the  description  of  the  blemishes  were 

adopted  and 

the 

terms  which  can  bring  confusions  were  eliminated. 

Furthermore,  this  article  shows  the  need  of  knowledge  about  the  histological 

and  physiological  changes  induced  by  abiotic  and/or  biotic  stresses  causing 

atypical  blemishes.  It  appears  as  well  that  several  hypotheses  have  been 

proposed  to  determine  the  causes  of  the  atypical  blemishes  but  reproducing 

potato-soil-borne  pathosystems  under  controlled  conditions  appeared  to  be 

difficult  task  thus  the  Koch’s  postulates  difficult  to  fulfill.  The  authors  sincerely 

hope  that  this  article  will  catch  the  attention  of  the  potato  community  on  this 

major  economical  problem  of  potato  tuber  blemishes  and  will  facilitate  future 

researches, 

the  establishment  of  seed  certification  standards  and 

the 

improvement  of  varietal  assessment.  Indeed,  the  determination  of  potato 

blemishes'  causes  often  refers  to  known  diseases  while  visual  observations 

relate to symptoms of diverse origins. In the future, this new nomenclature will 

be optimized by being translated into several different languages, and will also 

be  extended  to  other  blemishes  which  are  important  for  other  potato  areas, 

allowing the harmonization of potato blemish terminology in all the branches of 

the potato production systems.

Abstract 

 

 

Skin  blemishes  of  potato  (Solanum  tuberosum  L.)  tubers  can  cause  severe 

economical  losses  to  the  production.  Some  blemishes  are  due  to  known 

pathogens  and  others  whose  causes  are  unknown  are  called  atypical 

blemishes.  The  present  work  aims  at  determining  the  origin  of  superficial 

atypical  blemishes  on  a  set  of  204  tubers  coming  from  12  different  French 

regions  producing  potato.  The  diversity  of  fungi  and  Streptomyces  bacteria 

associated with blemishes was investigated by systematic isolation followed by 

identification of the strains by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer of the 

ribosomal  DNA  for  fungi  and  by  sequencing  the  16S  ribosomal  DNA  for 

bacteria. We found a high microbial diversity represented by 349 fungal isolates 

belonging  to  at  least  47  different  species  and  21  bacterial  strains  of 

Streptomyces  sp.  The  most  represented  fungi  belonged  to  the  genera 

Fusarium,  Rhizoctonia,  Alternaria,  Penicillium,  and  Clonostachys.  The 

pathogenicity  of  representative 

isolated  strains  was  assessed 

in 

three 

bioassays;  two  bioassays  based  on  single  inoculations  in  previously  sterilized 

potting mixture, and one bioassay based on both single and double inoculations 

under hydroponic conditions. We fulfilled the Koch's postulates for Rhizoctonia 

solani AG 3 causing sclerotia. For other fungal and bacterial strains, our results 

did  not  show  any  causality  or  relationship  between  a  strain  or  a  complex  of 

strains  and  the  occurrence  of  the  blemishes.  Moreover,  the  observation  of 

irregular polygonal sunken corky lesions (polygonal lesions) - the most frequent 

atypical  blemish  -  on  non-inoculated  tubers,  suggested  that  the  atypical 

blemishes  could  be  as  well  a  reaction  of  the  plant  to  stressful  environmental 

conditions.

Introduction  

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the fourth main crop in the world after 

wheat, rice, and maize. Since the early 1990s, the potato sector is undergoing 

major changes worldwide. The global production increased by 20 % especially 

in developing countries which are changing their nutritional habits particularly in 

urban areas (Lutaladio and Castaidi, 2009). In most European countries, ware 

potatoes are now washed before selling. Washing the tubers reveals superficial 

blemishes and may reduce the commercial value of the commodity. Blemishes 

or superficial alterations affect only the tuber skin, without affecting the taste or 

the nutritional properties. However, they have a negative cosmetic effect on the 

tubers and destroy the integrity of the natural barrier of the skin. Thereby, they 

form  an  entry  point  for  pathogenic  microorganisms.  Moreover,  it  has  been 

shown  that  skin  visual  appearance  is  the  most  important  factor  influencing 

consumers'  behaviour  in  fresh  potato  purchase.  Economical  data  about  such 

potential  losses  are  difficult  to  estimate  but  all  potato  sectors,  i.e.  seed,  ware, 

and processing are concerned.  

Potato tubers can show a large range of superficial blemishes. These blemishes 

may result from a pathogen attack or from unfavourable environmental factors. 

When  their  causes  are  known  and  the  Koch's  postulates  have  been  fulfilled, 

these  blemishes  are  called  typical  blemishes.  The  typical  blemishes  of 

pathogenic  origin  are  due  to  various  diseases  caused  by  fungi,  bacteria, 

nematodes  or  viruses.  Black  dot  caused  by  Colletotrichum  coccodes,  silver 

scurf (Helminthosporium solani), skin spot (Polyscytalum pustulans), black scurf 

(Rhizoctonia  solani),  and  powdery  scab  (Spongospora  subterranea)  are  well 

known fungal diseases (Radtke and Rieckmann, 1991; Stevenson et al., 2001). 

The  most  widely  spread  bacterial  disease  of  potato  in  the  world  is  due  to 

Streptomyces  spp.  causing  common  scab  and  netted  scab  and  the  most 

frequently observed symptom due to nematode is stubby-root nematode lesions 

caused by Paratrichodorus spp. and Trichodorus spp. nematodes.  Potato Virus 
Yntn,  Tobacco  Rattle  Virus  (TRV),  and  Tobacco  Necrosis  Virus  (TNV)  are  also 

known to cause superficial blemishes on potato tubers. Abiotic factors such as 

humidity, 

temperature, 

light,  chemical  products,  nutrient  deficiency  or

mechanical damage cause enlarged lenticels, skin discoloration, tuber cracks or 

bruising.  On  the  contrary,  the  blemishes  for  which  the  causal  agent  has  not 

been clearly identified are called atypical blemishes. 

In  a  previous  study  (Fiers,  2010),  most  of  tuber  blemishes  were  classified 

according  to  the  type  of  symptom:  sclerotia,  enlarged  lenticels,  skinning, 

russeting,  common  scab,  netted  scab  and  atypical  corky  blemishes.  The  latter 

including  corky  cracks,  corky  spots  or  "rhizoscab",  star-like  corky  lesions  and 

blemishes  commonly  called  "elephant  hide",  described  as  irregular  polygonal 

sunken corky lesions. These will hereafter be called polygonal lesions. Atypical 

blemishes frequently observed in ware potato production are the atypical corky 

blemishes, especially polygonal lesions and corky spots. Black scurf or sclerotia 

are  known  to  be  the  long  term  survival  form  of  R.  solani  (Anderson,  1982;  El 

Bakali  and  Martin,  2006)  and  common  and  netted  scab  have  been 

unequivocally demonstrated to be caused by Streptomyces spp. (Lambert and 

Loria, 1989). These typical blemishes (sclerotia, common scab and netted scab) 

were integrated in this study as reference blemishes.  

Production  of  all  types  of  potato  commodities  aims  at  providing  high  quality 

tubers,  either  ware  potatoes  or  seed  tubers  that  need  to  meet  the  market 

demands related to the visual quality of the tubers. Atypical blemishes are then 

a  predominant  obstacle  to  the  fulfilment  of  this  quality  requirement.  Thus  the 

determination  of  the  causes  of  blemishes  is  needed.  Assuming  that  atypical 

blemishes  are  of  biological  origin,  two  related  hypotheses  were  considered: 

atypical  blemishes  are  due  to  pathogenic  microorganisms  not  yet  identified  or 

they are due to known pathogens producing atypical symptoms. Some atypical 

blemishes closely resemble netted scab caused by Streptomyces spp. but they 

are  also occasionally  attributed  to  R.  solani Kühn  (teleomorph:  Thanatephorus 

cucumeris  (Franck)  Donk)  (Campion  et  al.,  2003).  This  is  the  reason  why  R. 

solani and Streptomyces were investigated as well. The objectives of this study 

were (1) to isolate potential pathogens from atypical skin blemishes, and (2) test 

whether  the  isolated  microorganisms  are  able  to  re-create  the  atypical 

blemishes on progeny tubers and so doing, verifying Koch's postulates.

Materials and methods 

Plant material 

Potato  tubers  were  collected  in  2006  and  2007  in  12  different  French 

departments  representing  production  bases  for  seeds  as  well  as  for  ware 

potatoes.  In  2006  and  2007,  samplings  were  made  in  51  and  39  fields, 

respectively. From each field, 1 to 4 tubers representative of the overall diversity 

of blemishes were chosen for the study, resulting in a collection of 148 and 56 

tubers sampled in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Though 42 different cultivars of 

potato were represented, the genetic background of S. tuberosum has been set 

aside deliberately in this study because the relationship between potato cultivar 

and  soil-borne  parasites  are  highly  complex  and  still  not  fully  understood. 

Blemishes  were  observed  and  classified  into  10  groups  (Table  3.1).  Atypical 

corky  blemishes  are  illustrated  in  Figure  3.1.  The  tubers  were  stored  in  paper 

bags at 4°C during several weeks until the start of  the experiment.

Isolation of fungi 

 

Tubers were washed under running tap water and air dried. A picture of 

each  affected  tuber  was  taken.  A  6  mm  diameter  and  5  mm  deep  piece  was 

excised  with  a  cork  borer  from  the  affected  area  of  each  tuber.  The  explants 

were surface sterilized in 1 % bleach for 15 s and rinsed three times in sterile 

water.  Each  tuber  explant  was  dried  on  sterile  paper,  and  plated  on  potato

dextrose  agar  (PDA).  For  the  tubers  collected  in  2006,  a  second  explant  per 

tuber was taken and plated on water agar. 

After  5  days  of  incubation  at  room  temperature  under  natural  light,  fungal 

colonies  developing  from  the  plant  material  were  identified  by  microscopic 

observations  and  purified  at  least  twice  by  serial  transfers  on  PDA.  A  total  of 

349 fungal isolates was recovered (Table 3.1) and stored both on PDA at room 

temperature and by cryopreservation at -80°C in the  collection “Microorganisms 

of Interest for Agriculture and Environment” (MIAE, INRA Dijon, France). 

Isolation of Streptomyces  

Streptomyces  spp.  were  isolated  from  tubers  collected  in  2007  showing 

skinning  (1  tuber),  common  scab  (5  tubers),  star-like  corky  lesions  (1  tuber), 

polygonal lesions (16 tubers) and netted scab (4 tubers). Isolations were made 

according to the method described by Bouchek-Mechiche et al. (2000b). Tubers 

were  washed  under  tap  water,  disinfected  in  ethanol  from  1  min  for  very 

superficial  blemishes  to  5  min  for  deeper  blemishes.  They  were  rinsed  in  two 

consecutive baths of sterile water and air dried for at least 3 h. About 50 mg of 

affected  skin  was  excised  by  scraping  the  tuber  surface  with  a  sterile  scalpel 

and collected in a sterile mortar. One hundred µl of sterile water was aseptically 

added,  and  the mixture  was  homogenised  with  a  pestle;  then,  about  400  µl  of 

sterile water was added to get a smooth and homogenous mixture. After serial 
dilutions  in  sterile  water,  200  µl  of  dilutions  10-3  and  10-5  for  superficial 
blemishes and dilutions 10-4 and 10-6 for deep blemishes were deposited in a 9 

cm  Petri  dish.  Twenty  ml  of  tyrosine,  sodium  caseinate,  sodium  nitrate  (TCN) 
medium  (1  g  l-1  of  L-tyrosine,  25  g  l-1  of  sodium  caseinate,  10  g  l-1  of  sodium 
nitrate,  15  g  l-1  of  agar)  maintained  at  45°C  was  added.  Four  replic ates  per 

dilution were made. Plates were incubated at 27°C f or 10 days. Each colony of 

Streptomyces was transferred to PDA and stored at 4°C. A total  of 21 isolates 

of Streptomyces were collected from 27 tubers collected in 2007 (Table 3.1).

Molecular identification of fungal isolates 

 

For  DNA  extraction,  all  the  collected  fungal  isolates  were  cultivated  in 

tubes  on  PDA  slants.  Two  ml  of  potato  dextrose  broth  (PDB)  was  poured  into 

PDA tubes and vortexed to disperse the spores, and the spores-PDB mix was 

poured into Roux flasks containing 100 ml of PDB. For non-sporulating fungi, 6 

explants of PDA were directly placed into Roux flasks. Flasks were incubated at 

room temperature without shaking for 2 to 3 days. The mycelium was harvested 

by filtration, frozen at -80°C during 30 min, lyoph ilized and stored at -80°C.  

The  mycelium  was  ground  in  liquid  nitrogen  in  a  sterile  mortar  to  obtain  a 

mycelium  powder.  The  DNA  was  extracted  from  20  mg  of  mycelium  powder 

using  DNeasy  plant  mini  kit  (Qiagen,  Courtaboeuf,  France)  according  to  the 

manufacturer's  protocol.  The  DNA  quantity  and  quality  were  checked  by 

electrophoresis  on  a  0.8  %  agarose  gel,  revealed  with  ethidium  bromide  and 

visualized by UV trans-illumination. The DNA concentrations calculated with the 

image  analysis  software  Bio-Profil  Bio1D++  (Windows  Application  V11.9, 

Copyright ©2004 Vilbert-Lourmat) were between 3.5 and 125 ng/µl. 

For  each  fungal  isolate,  the  internal  transcribed  spacer  (ITS)  region  of  the 

ribosomal  DNA  (rDNA)  was  amplified  by  PCR  with  the  primers  ITS1-F 

(CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA)  and  ITS4  (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) 

(White  et  al.,  1990;  Gardes  and  Bruns,  1993).  PCR  amplifications  were 

performed in a final volume of 50 µl by mixing 2 µl of DNA with 0.5 µM of each 

primer, 150 µM of dNTP, 6 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Q-Biogen, Evry, France) 

and  PCR  reaction  buffer.  Amplification  was  conducted  in  a  mastercycler 

(Eppendorf, Hambourg, Germany) with an initial denaturation of 3 min at 94°C, 

followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 72°C, and a final 

extension  of  10  min  at    72°C.  Aliquots  of  PCR  produ cts  were  checked  by 

electrophoresis  on  a  1  %  agarose  gel,  revealed  with  ethidium  bromide  and 

visualized by UV trans-illumination. 

The PCR products were sequenced by Beckman Coulters Genomics (Takeley, 

UK)  using  primers  ITS1-F  and  ITS4.  For  each  PCR  product,  sequences  from 

both  strands  were  assembled  to  produce  a  consensus  sequence.  Sequence 

identities were determined using BLAST analyses from the National Center for 

Biotechnology Information (NCBI) available on line.

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

Molecular identification of Streptomyces isolates 

Streptomyces isolates stored at 4°C on PDA were cultivated in 2 5 ml of 
Luria Bertani (LB) media (10 g l-1 of bacto tryptone, 5 g l-1 of yeast extract, 10 g 
l-1 of NaCl; pH 7) for 6 days at 27°C. The DNA was ext racted using the DNeasy 

Blood  and  Tissue  kit  (Qiagen)  according  to  the  manufacturer's  specifications. 

The  DNA  quantity  and  quality  were  checked  by  electrophoresis  as  above  and 

the DNA concentrations calculated as above were between 4 and 650 ng/µl. 

For  each  Streptomyces  isolate,  the  16S  rDNA  was  amplified  by  PCR  with  the 

primers 27F (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) (Edwards et al., 1989) and 1392R 

(ACGGGCGGTGTGTACA) 

(Braker  et  al.,  2001).  PCR 

reactions  were 

performed  in  a  final  volume  of  50  µl  by  mixing  10  µl  of  DNA  with  0.2  µM  of 

primer 27F, 0.2 µM of 1392R, 200 µM of dNTP, 12 U of Taq DNA polymerase 

(Q-Biogen)  and  PCR  reaction  buffer.  Amplifications  were  conducted  in  a 

mastercycler (Eppendorf) with an initial denaturation of 3 min at 95°C, followed 

by  35  cycles  of  1  min  at  95°C,  1  min  at  57°C,  1  min   at  72°C,  and  a  final 

extension  of  5  min  at    72°C.  Aliquots  of  PCR  produc ts  were  checked  by 

electrophoresis on a 1 % agarose gel as above. 

The  PCR  products  were  sequenced  using  primers  27F  and  1392R.  For  each 

PCR  product,  sequences  from  both  strands  were  assembled  to  produce  a 

consensus  sequence.  Sequences  identities  were  determined  using  BLAST  as 

above.  

Pathogenicity tests 

Strains  representative  of  the  most  frequently  isolated  fungal  and 

Streptomyces  species  were  tested  for  their  pathogenicity  on  potato  tubers.  In 

order  to  fulfil  Koch's  postulates  for  these  strains,  two  different  types  of 

bioassays were set up: a pot-test with artificially infested soil and a test where 

potatoes were grown under hydroponic conditions.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

107

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

Bioassays in soil 

 

The bioassays were conducted in 2007 and 2008 in a greenhouse from 

April  to  September.  Healthy  potato  tubers  were  grown  in  pots  containing  soil 

artificially  infested  with  fungal  or  Streptomyces  isolates.  Thirty-three  strains 

were  tested  in  2007  and  48  strains  in  2008.  Nine  strains  were  tested  twice 

(Table  3.2). 

In  addition, 

four  reference  strains  were 

tested:  Fusarium 

sambucinum  (TFSa,  isolated  in  France  2007),  F.  solani  var.  coeruleum  (T 

FSC1, isolated in France 2006) R. solani AG 3 (i4 / 9729-1, isolated in France 

1999), and R. solani AG 2-1 (0799-001 2N WA, isolated in Morocco 2007).  

Fungal  inoculum  was  prepared  on  autoclaved  millet  seeds.  Forty  grams  of 

seeds were mixed in jars  with 32 ml of sterile deionised water and autoclaved 

for 45 min at 110°C on two consecutive days and for  20 min at 120°C the third 

day. The jars were stored at room temperature during 4 days before inoculation 

to allow the release of putative toxic compounds (mainly NH3). Six plugs of 12 

day-old  fungal  cultures  on  PDA  were  introduced  and  mixed  with  the  millet 

seeds.  The  cultures  were  incubated  at  room  temperature  for  3  weeks  with 

regular shaking.  

For  the  Streptomyces  inoculum,  Streptomyces  spp.  were  grown  on  9  cm  PDA 

plates.  Prior  to  the  inoculum  setting,  a  specific  substrate  for  the  Streptomyces 

inoculum was prepared. One liter of vermiculite, mixed with 150 ml of deionized 

water was autoclaved for 1 h at 120°C, on two conse cutive days. 170 ml Say's 
media (sucrose 20 g l-1; asparagine 1.2 g l-1; K2HPO4 0.6 g l-1; yeast extract 10 g 
l-1)  was  added  to  the  vermiculite  and  autoclaved  for  30  min  at  115°C. 

Streptomyces  mat  and  spores  were  scraped  from  7  to  10  day-old  culture  on 
oatmeal agar (oatmeal powder 50 g l-1; agar 23.5 g l-1) at 27 °C and ground in a 

sterile mortar with 8 ml sterile water. The resulting mixture was poured into the 

sterile vermiculite substratum and was incubated for 2 to 3 weeks at 27°C with 

daily shaking (Wanner, 2004).  

The potting mixture (one third of sand and two thirds of peat) used to grow the 

potatoes  was  steam-disinfected  and  stored  at  room  temperature  for  7  days  to 

allow  putative  toxic  compounds  to  be  released.  The  fungal  and  Streptomyces 

inocula were mixed separately with about 6 l of disinfected potting mixture with 

a  three-dimensional  shaker  (Turbula,  System  Schatz).  The  infested  potting 

 108

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

mixture was placed in 10 l plastic pots (25 cm diameter, 30 cm high). The pots 

infested with Streptomyces were prepared two  weeks before planting, covered 

with a plastic cover and kept at room temperature for about 15 days to allow the 

establishment and multiplication of the bacteria. 

One seed tuber was planted in each pot. Cultivar Charlotte was chosen for soil 

assays  because  it  is  one  of  the  cultivars  that  is  mostly  cited  in  the  sample 

collections  (2006  and  2007)  and  because  it  has  a  medium  to  high  overall 

susceptibility  to  atypical  superficial  blemishes  (FNPPPT  and  GNIS,  2007, 

Chatot,  personnal  data).  Commercial  certified  seeds  (Class  A;  25-32)  were 

used  and  visually  examined  for  absence  of  any  skin  blemish.    Plants  were 

grown  in  a  glasshouse  at  room  temperature  with  minimal  temperature of 10°C 

and  maximal  temperature  of  25°C  with  a  16  h  day  len gth,  for  approximately  4 
months,  until  natural  maturity;  additional  light  (200  W/m2)  was  provided  when 

needed.  Plants  were  regularly  watered,  but  soil  moisture  content  was  not 

monitored.  Fertilizing  watering  was  carried  out  every  week  with  a  fertilizer 

solution  (N  P  K,  20  20  20).  Plants  were  harvested  in  September.  A  non 

inoculated control and three replicate pots per treatment were set up. 

At harvest, one gram of soil from each pot was spread on PDA in a Petri dish to 

check  the  survival  and  viability  of  the  inoculated  fungi  and  bacteria  during  the 

assay.  After  4  days,  the  presence  of  the  inoculated  microorganisms  was 

checked under a microscope.  

Progeny tubers from the same plant were washed under running tap-water, air-

dried, weighed and stored in a paper bag. The number of tubers per plant was 

recorded  and  the  tubers  larger  than  3  cm  long  were  scored  individually 

according to the different classes of blemishes. The scoring scale edited by the 

French official service of control and certification (SOC) (GNIS and SOC, 2005) 

was adapted to black scurf, netted scab and common scab scales, each with 10 

different levels of disease severity. Black scurf scale was: 0 = no lesion, 1 = 1 % 

of area covered by lesions; 3 = 4% of area covered by lesions; 5 = 9 % of area 

covered  by  lesions;  7  =  14  %  of  area  covered  by  lesions;  9  =  35  %  of  area 

covered by lesions. Netted and common scab scales scored tuber as following: 

0 = no lesion, 1 = 4 % of area covered by lesions; 3 = 6% of area covered by 

lesions;  5  =  30  %  of  area  covered  by  lesions;  7  =  45  %  of  area  covered  by 

lesions; 9 = 60 % of area covered by lesions 

 

109

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

 The  intensity  of  sclerotia  was  scored  according  to  the  R.  solani  scale,  from 

level 1 (1 % of the tuber surface covered by the blemish) to level 9 (>35 % of 

the  tuber  surface  covered  by  the  blemish).  Other  blemishes  were  scored 

according to the common and netted scab scale, from level 1 (4 % of the tuber 

surface covered by the blemish) to level 9 (> 60% of the tuber surface covered 

by  the  blemish). The  intensity  was  calculated  by  averaging  the  intensity  of  the 

reproduced  blemish  for  the  3  replicates  (6  when  the  strain  was  tested  twice 

(Table  3.2).  Fungi  and  Streptomyces  were  isolated  from  the  progeny  tubers 

following the same protocol as above. 

Co-inoculation tests under hydroponic conditions 

In  the  second  type  of  test,  potatoes  were  grown  under  hydroponic 

conditions in order to follow the development of the blemishes in-situ. A total of 

22  strains  of  fungi  and  Streptomyces  spp.  were  tested  in  single  and  co-

inoculations, resulting in 49 different treatments (Table 3.3). 

The experimental system (adapted from Gray, 1973) (Figure 3.2) consisted of a 

tray  (40  cm  in  diameter  and  10  cm  in  depth)  with  a  5  cm  diameter  hole  in  the 

centre, placed on a 5 l pot containing nutrient solution (N P K, 13 21 13 or N P 

K,  8  17  24,  see  below)  (Algospeed  Flo,  Compo,  France).  A  seed  tuber  was 

placed in the centre of the tray on a plastic screen of 1 cm mesh, maintaining 

the tuber in the tray, away from the water but allowing the roots to elongate into 

the nutrient solution. Certified seeds (Class A, 28-35) of the cultivar Bintje were 

used; this cultivar is known for its susceptibility to overall skin blemishes

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

 

 
Figure 3.2 Scheme of the experimental set up of the assay under hydroponic conditions 

 

A  sterile  mixture  of  7  l  of  perlite  and  vermiculite  (50/50  v/v)  was  placed  in  the 

tray as to completely cover the seed tuber; it was regularly moistened to initiate 

the development of roots and stolons. Stems were supported by a stick. All pots 

were  set  in  a  greenhouse;  the  day  length  was  12  h  30  and  temperature  was 

kept  at  15°C  during  the  day  and  10°C  during  the  nig ht.  After  2  weeks,  when 

sprouting was initiated the perlite-vermiculite mixture was removed and the tray 

was covered with a black foam disc to keep the newly formed tubers in the dark. 

During  the  course  of  the  experiment,  nutrient  solution  was  aerated  with  an  air 

pump (Hiblow, Airpump Takatsuki). The nutrient solution (N P K, 13 21 13) was 

used  during  the  initiation  of  the  stolons  with  a  high  content  in  phosphorus  to 

favour root development. After 2 months it was changed to (N P K, 8 17 24), a 

solution with more potassium to strengthen tubers. The pots were emptied and 

filled again with fresh nutrient solution (pH ≈ 6 and conductivity ≈ 1500 µS) once 

a week. 

Two  and  a  half  months  after  plantation,  when  progeny  tubers  reached  a 

sufficient  size  (i.e.  >  2  cm  long),  they  were  inoculated  with  one or  two  strains. 

Inoculations  were  performed  using  plugs  of  10  day-old  microbial  cultures  on 

PDA plates. Six visually healthy progeny tubers per plant were chosen. Three of 

them were wounded with a sterile toothpick and the three others were not. For 

each treatment, plugs of the inoculated strains were placed side by side on the 

tubers, on the wound for wounded tubers. For each treatment corresponding to 

single  or  double  inoculations,  three  independent  plants  were  inoculated.  A

Results 

Among the samples collected in 2006 and 2007, the blemishes the most 

frequently  observed  were  polygonal  lesions,  representing  22  %  of  the  total 

blemishes, followed by sclerotia (16 %), enlarged lenticels (15 %), corky spots 

(13 %), common scab (8 %), corky cracks (8 % ), star-like corky lesions (7 %), 

skinning  (5  %),  netted  scab  (4  %),  and  russeting  (2  %).  The  atypical  corky 

blemishes  (polygonal  lesions,  corky  spots,  corky  cracks  and  star-like  corky 

lesions) all together represented 50 % of the observed blemishes. 

Identification of fungi 

Twenty  six  different  fungal  genera  were  found  among  the  349  isolates 

collected  from  blemishes  and  identified  from  their  ITS  sequence  (Table  3.1). 

The  most  represented  genera  were  Fusarium  (80  strains),  Rhizoctonia  (68 

strains),  Alternaria  (46  strains),  Penicillium  (33  strains),  and  Clonostachys  (27 

strains). Most of the isolates were identified at the species level, however, some 

isolates  were  only  identified  at  the  genus  level,  because  either  their  ITS 

sequence had the same percentage of similarity as two or more fungal species 

or the obtained ITS sequence was too short. Finally, at least 45 different fungal

species  were  identified.  In  the  case  of  R.  solani  isolates,  the  anastomosis 

groups (AG) were also determined based on ITS sequences (Table 3.1).

Pathogenicity tests 

Bioassays in soil 

The inoculated strains were re-isolated from the soil in 39% of the cases. 

Fungi  belonging  to  the  Rhizoctonia  solani  species  were  more  frequently  re-

isolated than the other species. 

The  results  of  the  two  bioassays  conducted  in  soil  are  presented  in  table  3.2. 

Among  the  62  fungal  strains  and  the  8  Streptomyces  strains  inoculated,  30 

fungi  and  1 Streptomyces  were  re-isolated  from  the  progeny  tuber  surfaces  at 

the end of the tests. Several other fungi that were not initially inoculated in pots 

were  also  isolated  such  as  Trichoderma  spp.,  Mucor  spp.  and  Colletotrichum 

spp. Among the inoculated fungi, R. solani was the species the most frequently 

re-isolated  from  tubers  (16  strains  out  of  21  were  recovered  on  the  progeny 

tuber  surface).  Conversely,  only  one  out  of  the  7  Alternaria  strains  tested  and 

none  of  the  8  Clonostachys  strains  tested  were  recovered  from  the  progeny 

tuber surface.

Non-inoculated control 
(a) The codification of the strains includes the year of isolation (two first digits), the geographical zone of isolation corresponding to the French departments (third and fourth digits) and the strain 
identification number (last digits and letters). Strains followed by an asterisk (*) were tested in the two different bioassays (2007; 2008). Strains followed by two asterisks (**) are reference strains, 
which were not sequenced in this study. 
(b) Collection MIAE, Microorganisms of Interest for Agriculture and Environment (INRA Dijon, France). 
(c) Intensities of blemishes were scored according to the official French scales of the tuber potato diseases (GNIS and FNPPPT). Sclerotia were scored from level 1 (1 % of the tuber surface covered 
by the blemish) to level 9 (>35 % of the tuber surface covered by the blemish) and the other blemishes were scored from level 1 (4 % of the tuber surface covered by the blemish) to level 9 (> 60% of 
the tuber surface is covered by the blemish). 
(d) + means that the inoculated strain was isolated from the progeny tubers; - means that the inoculated strain was not isolated from the progeny tubers.

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

In  all  the  treatments,  all  types  of  blemishes  were  observed  with  a  variable 

intensity,  but  the  original  blemishes  were  rarely  reproduced  by  the  inoculated 

strains.  There  was  no  clear  relationship  between  the  type  of  blemish  and  the 

taxonomic status of the strains. However the strains of R. solani AG 3 were able 

to cause sclerotia (4 of the strains) as well as polygonal lesions (4 other strains) 

and  one  strain  generated  corky  crack,  on  the  progeny  tubers.  One  of  9  F. 

oxysporum strains was able to cause polygonal lesions. One of the three strains 

of  P.  brevicompactum,  two  strains  of  R.  solani,  and  the  only  strain  of  P. 

cucumerina  caused  enlarged  lenticels.  Among  the  strains  of  Streptomyces 

tested,  none  has  produced  the  same  blemish  as  the  one  from  which  it  was 

isolated. Progeny tubers coming from the non-inoculated controls also showed 

blemishes:  skinning  (6  out  of  6  tubers),  enlarged  lenticels  (5  out  of  6  tubers), 

and polygonal lesions (1 out of 6 tubers). 

The intensity of reproduced blemishes varied from 1 to 6 with an average of 1.6, 

which means that in average, less than 6 % of tuber surfaces was covered by a 

given type of blemish. In general, blemishes intensities were low. Some tubers 

showed  several  different  types  of  blemishes  making  it  difficult  to  make  a 

connection between the isolated strain and a specific blemish. 

Co-inoculation tests under hydroponic conditions 

 

 

Before  inoculation,  43  %  of  the  progeny  tubers  already  displayed 

polygonal lesions with an average intensity of 3, meaning that 6 % of the tuber 

surface was covered by the blemish. The blemishes observed during the seven 

weeks following the inoculation, are listed in Table 3.3. Corky cracks, polygonal 

lesions,  enlarged  lenticels,  skinning,  and  star-like  corky  blemishes  were 

produced on progeny tubers grown under hydroponic conditions and inoculated 

with one or two selected strains. For each treatment, a variety of blemishes was 

observed without any relationship between the strain inoculated and blemishes. 

In  none  of  the  treatments,  the  inoculated  fungus  or  Streptomyces  were  re-

isolated from progeny tubers after harvest. However, numerous Mucor spp. and 

Penicillium spp. were isolated. The diversity of blemishes and of fungi isolated 

from  the  non-inoculated  tubers  was  similar  to  the  one  from  the  inoculated 

tubers.

Growing  tubers  under  hydroponic  conditions  allowed  the  observation  of  formation 

and development of blemishes during tuber growth. It often appeared, on inoculated 

tubers  as  well  as  on  non-inoculated  tubers  that  wound  and  opened  lenticel  healing 

formed  polygonal  and  star-like  corky  lesions.  We  also  observed  that  polygonal 

lesions  and  corky  cracks  frequently  resulted  from  the  development  of  skinning  and 

star-like corky lesions along with tuber growing period. Finally, crack formations were 

observed at the end of the growing period, when tubers tended to grow faster. 

 

 

 

 

Discussion 

The objective of this study was to investigate the microbial origin of potato skin 

tuber  blemishes.  We  made  a  large  collection  of  tubers  showing  different  types  of 

blemish,  and 

isolated  and 

identified  microorganisms  associated  with 

these 

blemishes. At least 45 different species of fungi and 1 species of Streptomyces were 

isolated.  Fusarium,  Rhizoctonia,  Alternaria,  Penicillium  and  Clonostachys  were  the 

genera the most frequently isolated. Fusarium, Rhizoctonia and Alternaria are known 

to be present at the surface of potato tubers and in the rhizosphere of potato plants 

(Cwalina-Ambroziak,  2002;  Pieta  and  Patkowska,  2003).  They  are  known  to  be 

responsible for dry rots, black scurf and stem canker and early blight, respectively, on 

potato  crop  (Radtke  and  Rieckmann,  1991;  Stevenson  et  al.,  2001).  Clonostachys, 

especially  C.  rosea  (formerly  Gliocladium  roseum,  Schroers  et  al.,  1999)  could  be 

either  a  pathogenic  agent  causing  dry  rot  (Theron,  1991)  or  a  biological  agent 

controlling  several  potato  soil-borne  diseases  (Keinath  et  al.,  1991;  Davide  and 

Zorilla, 1995). Penicillium species were isolated from potato tubers and identified as 

saprophytic  strains  (Cwalina-Ambroziak,  2002).  To  our  knowledge  it  is  the first  time 

that  P.  brevicompactum,  the  most  common  Penicillium  species  found  in  our  study, 

was isolated from potato tubers. Thus, tubers are an ecological niche favourable for 

the  development  of  a  diversity  of  fungi  and  bacteria,  both  pathogens  and 

Though  quite  diverse,  the  microflora  present  at  the  surface  of  tubers  displaying 

blemishes might have been underestimated by the isolation technique. Extracting the 

DNA directly from the tuber blemishes could have revealed an even larger spectrum 

of microorganisms. However, such a direct approach was not adapted to our purpose 

saprophytes. 

 120

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

since  it  would  not  have  allowed  us  to  isolate  the  microorganisms,  characterize  and 

test them individually in bioassays. 

Only  one  sample  of  each  blemish  type,  skinning  and  star-like  corky  lesion,  was 

analysed  for  the  isolation  of  Streptomyces.  No  Streptomyces  were  isolated  from 

these  blemishes.  Further  research  needs  to  be  done  to  know  if  Streptomyces  does 

interfere with the formation of skinning and star-like corky lesions, or not.  

A diversity of fungi was isolated in this study, direct observation using a microscope 

often  allowed  their  identification  at  the  genus  level  but  further  identification  at  the 

species  level  frequently  required  molecular  tools.  The  ITS  sequence  and  the  16S 

rDNA  sequence  are  generally  used  as  a  species  marker  among  fungi  or 

Streptomyces,  respectively.  In  our  study,  75  %  of  the  strains  were  identified  at  the 

species level by sequencing their ITS region or the 16S rDNA. Most of the remaining 

strains  were  not  identified  at  the  species  level  because  of  a  too  short  sequence. 

However,  this  does  not  stand  for  the  strains  belonging  to  the  genus  Alternaria. 

Several  of  them  could  not  be  identified  at  the  species  level  even  with  an  almost 

complete ITS sequence because their ITS sequence matched two or more Alternaria 

species.  In  these  cases,  sequencing  of  the  genes  coding  the  elongation  factor,  the 

beta-tubulin, or the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit (mtLSU) might have been 

more  discriminative  (Peever  et  al.,  2004).  On  the  other  hand,  the  variability  of  ITS 

sequences  is  much  higher  in  R.  solani,  allowing  the  differentiation  of  AG  within  the 

species (Guillemaut et al., 2003). In our study, three different AGs were identified.  

The most important one was AG 3 - PT known to be the most frequent AG on potato 

(Kuninaga et al., 2000). In addition, 6 strains of R. solani AG 2-1 and 4 strains of R. 

solani AG 5 were also isolated. R. solani AG 3 – PT and AG 2-1 were mostly isolated 

from  sclerotia  whereas  R.  solani  AG  5  was  isolated  from  enlarged  lenticels  and 

russeting.  Similar  results  were  found  in  potato  crops  in  France  and  Great-Britain 

(Campion et al., 2003; Woodhall et al., 2007). 

Concerning the identification of Streptomyces, identification at the species level has 

not  been  possible  in  all  cases.  A  complementary  identification  method  based  on 

biochemical  characteristics  of  streptomycetes  could  be  used  (Bouchek-Mechiche  et 

al., 1998). Otherwise, a specific PCR for each species of Streptomyces could allow a 

quicker  and  complementary  detection.  An  amplification  of  the  16S  rDNA,  highly 

conserved,  and  amplification  of  the  ribosomal  intergenic  spacer  (RIS),  more 

 

 

121

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

 

discriminative, could allow a better identification of Streptomyces species (Lehtonen 

et al., 2004; Park and Kilbane, 2006). 

The second part of the study was to assess the pathogenicity of the isolated strains. 

Two different types of bioassays were set up. In the first one, the soil was artificially 

infested by the microbial strains in order to mimic field conditions. In the second one, 

potato plants were grown under hydroponic conditions and inoculated with one or two 

strains  of  potential  pathogens,  in  order  to  follow  the  development  of  the  blemishes. 

Although millet seeds used as inoculum were fully colonized, inoculated strains were 

not always detected in the soil at the end of the assay. This could be because the soil 

volume  tested  was  too  small,  or  because  other  species  isolated  from  soil  such  as 

Trichoderma or Mucor having a high growth rate, prevented the growth of the fungi of 

interest.  Among  the 72 fungal  strains tested  in  soil, only  14  were able  to  reproduce 

the  same  blemishes  they  originated  from;  the  other  strains  did  not  reproduce  the 

blemish  of  origin.  Among  the  11  Streptomyces  strains  tested,  none  was  able  to 

reproduce  the  type  of  blemish  it  originated  from.  According  to  Koch's  postulates,  a 

given strain can be considered as responsible for a symptom when it reproduces the 

original symptom and when the identical strain can be isolated at least once from the 

diseased  progeny  tubers  (Rapilly,  2001).  The  14  potentially  pathogenic  strains 

belonged  to  the  species  F.  oxysporum,  P.  brevicompactum,  P.  cucumerina,  and  R. 

solani  AG  3  -  PT.  Skinning,  enlarged  lenticels  and  polygonal  lesions  seemed  to  be 

the basal blemishes observed under the conditions of the assay rather than a result 

of the inoculum. Even though Fusarium spp. and more especially F. oxysporum were 

frequently isolated from blemishes and particularly associated with polygonal lesions, 

it seems that this species is well adapted to live on tuber surface as an opportunist. 

Because, polygonal lesions were also observed on the non-inoculated controls, it is 

not possible, at this point, to infer the involvement of this species in the formation of 

polygonal lesions. Similarly,  we cannot consider P. cucumerina, P. brevicompactum 

and R. solani AG 3 - PT as responsible for enlarged lenticels on potatoes. We know 

that a high level of humidity in the soil is favourable for the opening of lenticels as it 

was  observed  in  the  non-inoculated  controls  of  the  bioassays.  Opened  lenticels 

facilitate  penetration  of  microorganisms.  P.  cucumerina,  P.  brevicompactum  and  R. 

solani AG 3 - PT could be well adapted species to this specific niche and might be 

considered  as  opportunistic  colonizers  of  the  lenticels.  Moreover,  isolations  made 

from  soil  from  the  bioassays  showed  that  some  species  were  better  adapted  to 

 122

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

survive  in  the  soil  than  others  (data  not  shown).  R.  solani  did  not  spread 

homogenously  into  the  soil  since  it  was  much  more  often  recovered  from  the  tuber 

surface  than  from  the  soil.  Alternaria  spp.  and  Clonostachys  spp.  were  recovered 

neither from the soil nor from the tuber surface. While Clonostachys is known to be 

good saprophyte (Theron, 1991), Alternaria and R. solani are not. R. solani behaves 

as a root inhabiting fungus rather than as a soil fungus (Garrett, 1970). 

The  involvement  of  R.  solani  AG  3  -  PT  in  the  formation  of  polygonal  lesions  was 

observed in 4 independent replicates: this result confirms what is currently observed 

in  open  field  conditions  but  needs  further  investigation  under  controlled  conditions 

and artificial inoculation. Similarly, the contribution of R. solani AG 3 to the formation 

of corky crack was verified with only one strain. On the contrary, the pathogenicity of 

R. solani AG 3 - PT causing sclerotia was clearly demonstrated in four independent 

replicates.  The  involvement  of  R.  solani  AG  3  in  the  occurrence  of  sclerotia  has 

already been demonstrated several times (Anderson, 1982; Woodhall et al., 2008). 

Since  the  inoculation  of  single  strains  did  not  allow  the  reproduction  of  observed 

atypical blemishes, we assumed that a consortium of strains might be involved in the 

occurrence  of  blemishes.  Co-inoculations,  in  the  bioassay  in  hydroponic  conditions, 

did not demonstrate clear fungal or Streptomyces contribution into the occurrence of 

skin blemishes. Blemishes like skinning or star-like corky lesions could be the early 

stage of other blemishes like polygonal lesions. We also found a connection between 

wound healing and the formation of polygonal lesions. Moreover, the appearance of 

severe  polygonal  lesions  on  the  non-inoculated  tubers  under  hydroponic  conditions 

confirmed that this blemish could be skin response to other environmental factors. In 

the  60-70's  and  later  in  the  2000's,  several  publications  suggested  that  polygonal 

lesions  were  due  to  an  excess  of  humidity  or  organic  matter  (Hart,  1971;  Sexton, 

2003).  In  our  experimental  set  up,  the  high  moisture  content  due  to  hydroponic 

conditions is probably one of the causes of some of the blemishes. Polygonal lesions 

could be the result of a physiological reaction of the plant to stressful abiotic factors. 

Although, we noticed that cultivar Samba was particularly frequently associated with 

polygonal lesions, the genetic background of the potato germplasm was deliberately 

not taken into account in the expression of tuber blemishes because too little reliable 

data  are  available  on  the  host-parasite  relationships.  However,  the  S.  tuberosum  – 

Streptomyces  spp.  complex  is  one  of  few  that  gather  practical  data  at  the  cultivar 

level when assessed under controlled conditions and artificial inoculum (Pasco et al., 

 

 

123

Chapter 3 – Diversity and pathogenicity of microorganisms from blemishes 

2005),  although  its  expression  can  vary  because  it  is  highly  dependant  upon  biotic 

and abiotic environmental factors.  

 

This study showed the diversity of the microbial flora on the surface of potato 

tubers  and  demonstrated  that,  except  for  R.  solani  AG  3  -  PT  causing  sclerotia, 

blemishes  analyzed  in  this  study  could  not  be  directly  attributed  to  specific 

microorganisms. Evidences indicate that stress factors induce a differential response 

of the plant and the diversity of the microorganisms associated with the potato could 

be  a  natural  situation.  Cultivar  susceptibility  is  also  probably  a  key  to  blemish 

development  and  thus  control.  Complementary  studies  about  the  environmental 

conditions  responsible  for  development  of  potato  blemishes  and  the  assessment  of 

susceptible and resistant cultivars are needed.

Abstract 

Appearance of atypical blemishes on potato tubers is unexplained. The involvement 

of  soil  borne  microorganisms  has  so  far  never  been  demonstrated  except  for 

Rhizoctonia  solani  causing  black  scurf.  To  test  if  the  microbial  communities  of  the 

geocaulosphere  of  tubers  are  associated  to  the  occurrence  of  blemishes,  the 

bacterial  and  fungal  community  structures  of  the  soil  surrounding  healthy  and 

blemished 

tubers  were  analysed  by 

terminal 

restriction 

fragment 

length 

polymorphism (T-RFLP) before and after haulm destruction. 

The  same  T-RFLP  procedure  was  used  to  characterize  microorganisms  previously 

isolated  from  blemished  potatoes.  Bacterial  communities  around  healthy  tubers 

evolved  between  the  two  sampling  dates;  they  changed  toward  a  single  structure 

around  blemished 

tubers.  Fungal  community  structures  around  healthy  and 

blemished  tubers  were  different  one from  the  others  and  at  the  two  sampling  dates 

what reveals the succession of different populations along with the sanitary status of 

the  potato  and  with  the  season.  However,  although  differential  evolutions  of  the 

structures  of  microbial  communities  were  shown  to  be  related  to  the  blemish 

occurrences,  no  causality  link  was  depicted  apart  from  the  one  supposed  to  be  R. 

solani  population  that  significantly  increased  around  blemished  tubers  after  haulm 

destruction. 

 128

Chapter 4 – Microbial communities in the geocaulosphere of potato 

Introduction 

Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) are cropped almost everywhere in the world 

and the production increases every year since several decades. In 2007, about 325 

million  tons  were  produced  in  the  world.  The  quality  of  the  tubers  warranties  good 

production sell. However, since fresh tubers are washed before selling in most of the 

developed countries, several kinds of blemishes became visible on the tuber surface. 

Some  of  these  blemishes  (polygonal  lesions,  corky  cracks,  corky  spots,  star-like 

lesions with or  without halo, rugosities, skinning) are caused by factors that are still 

not well known (Campion et al., 2003). In a previous study, it has been demonstrated 

that  except 

for 

the 

fungus  Rhizoctonia  solani  which  causes  sclerotia, 

the 

microorganisms  present  at  the  tuber  surface  were  not  directly  implicated  in  the 

appearance  of  those  blemishes.  Conversely,  a  wide  diversity  of  microorganisms  is 

associated with potato surface (Fiers et al., 2010). Edaphic factors such as soil pH, 

organic  matter  rate,  water  supply,  or  the  presence  of  particular  nutrients  could  be 

involved.  In  addition  to  abiotic  factors,  the  microflora  harboured  by  the  soil 

surrounding the tuber (geocaulosphere) might influence the potato development and 

the  occurrence  of  blemishes.  The  term  'geocaulosphere'  built  up  with  the  same 

etymological  bases  as  the  term  'rhizosphere'  refers  to  the  soil  of  the  nearby 

environment  of 

tubers,  under 

the 

influence  of 

the  subterranean  stems. 

Microorganisms in the geocaulosphere could have an indirect impact on tubers and 

create 

favourable  (i.e.  stimulation  of  defence  mechanisms)  or  unfavourable 

conditions  (i.e.  modification  of  soil  pH  or  soil  moisture)  which  might  affect  potato 

development  and  blemish  occurrence.  To  assess  this  hypothesis,  the  bacterial  and 

fungal  community  structures  of  the  geocaulosphere  of  healthy,  blemished  and 

partially-healthy and blemished plants were compared at different periods of time by 

terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of 16S and 18S 

ribosomal  DNA  (rDNA),  respectively  (Liu  et  al.,  1997).  This  method  allows  the 

characterization of the microbial community structures in the form of variable terminal 

restriction  fragments  (TRF).  To  go  further  and  identify  the  microorganisms  of  the 

geocaulosphere  potentially  implicated  in  the  occurrence  of  blemishes,  the  specific 

TRF  of 56 microorganisms  isolated from potatoes  were  determined  using  the  same 

T-RFLP procedure.

Material and methods 

Soil sampling 

Soil  sampling  was  done  in  2008  in  a  potato  field  (cv.  Juliette)  located  in 

Morbihan in Western France (48°05' N, 2°51' W) at t wo consecutive dates: T1 at the 

end  of  July,  before  haulm  destruction  and  T2  at  the  end  of  August,  after  haulm 

destruction.  The  field  was  chosen  because  of  recurrent  problems  of  blemished 

tubers. A plot (15 m x 3 m) with 2 rows of potatoes (60 cm large) and 3 inter-rows (60 

cm large) was delimited.  At T1, 5 healthy plants and 5 plants whose progeny tubers 

were either healthy or blemished were chosen. At T2, 4 plants whose progeny tubers 

were  either  healthy  or  blemished  and  4  blemished  plants  were  chosen  (Table  4.1). 

There  were  no  completely  healthy  plants  in  the  plot  at  T2.  Three  tubers  were 

collected from healthy plants, 3 healthy tubers and 3 blemished tubers were collected 

from  partially-healthy  and  blemished  plants,  and  6  tubers  were  collected  from 

blemished plants. About 100 g of soil from the geocaulosphere of the collected tubers 

were sampled; the soil samples were placed in a plastic bag with the corresponding 

tuber.  At  each  sampling  date,  5  samples  of  soil  from  the  inter-rows  were  collected, 

pooled together and divided into 3 homogenised samples. A total of 99 soil samples 

were collected and brought back to the lab where they were immediately prepared for 

subsequent  analyses.  Each  soil  sample  was  stored  in  10  tubes  preserved  at  -20°C 

until  the  experiment  proceeded.  Potato  tubers  were  observed  and  the  superficial 

blemishes  were  scored  according  to  chart  approved  by  the  French  Ministry  of 

Agriculture (GNIS and SOC, 2005). A picture of each tuber was taken.

Bacterial and fungal community structures 

Nucleic  acids  were  extracted  from  1  g  of  soil  of  the  99  soil  samples  as 

described  previously  (Edel-Hermann  et  al.,  2004).  Briefly,  a  physical  disruption 

(bead-beater) and a chemical extractant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) at 70°C were used. 

The  crude  nucleic  acid  extracts  were  purified  twice  using  a  polyvinylpolypyrrolidone 

spin column to remove coextracted humic acids and once using a Geneclean Turbot

kit  (Q-BIOgene, 

Illkirch,  France).  Purified  DNA  extracts  were  quantified  by 

electrophoresis in agarose gels using dilutions of calf thymus DNA and stored at -20 

 

°C. 

The  genetic  structure  of  microbial  communities  in  the  different  soil  samples  was 

investigated using T-RFLP of 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes for bacteria 

and  fungi,  respectively  (Edel-Hermann  et  al.,  2004;  Perez-Piqueres  et  al.,  2006). 

Bacterial  16S 

rDNA  was  amplified  by  PCR  using 

the  primer  27F 

(AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) (Edwards et al., 1989) labelled with the fluorescent 

dye  D3  and  the  primer  1392R  (ACGGGCGGTGTGTACA)  (Braker  et  al.,  2001). 

Fungal  18S  rDNA  was  amplified  by  PCR  using  the  primer  nu-SSU-0817-5′ 

(TTAGCATGGAATAATRRAATAGGA)  labelled  with  the  fluorescent  dye  D3  and  the 

primer  nu-SSU-1536-3′  (ATTGCAATGCYCTATCCCCA)  (Borneman  and  Hartin, 

2000).  The  labelled  and  unlabelled primers were  synthesized  by  Sigma-Aldrich  and 

Eurofins  MWG  Operon  (Ebersberg,  Germany),  respectively.  PCR  amplification  of 

16S rDNA was carried out in 25 µL reactions including: Taq polymerase buffer, 200 

µM  dNTP,  0.2  µM  of  each  primer,  2  U  Taq  polymerase,  20  ng  DNA,  and  H2O.  All 

PCR  reagents  were  obtained  from  Q-BIOgene.  Amplifications  were  conducted  in  a 

Mastercycler 

(Eppendorf,  Hamburg,  Germany)  using 

the 

following 

reaction 

conditions:  initial  denaturation  at  94°C  for  3  min  followed  by  30  cycles  of  1  min  at 

94°C,  1  min  at  57°C  and  1  min  at  72°C  and  a  final  e longation  for  10  min  at  72°C. 

PCR  amplification  of  18S  rDNA  was  carried  out  using  identical  reagent  conditions 

except the primers at a concentration of 0.25 µM each. The PCR conditions for 18S 

rDNA included an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3  min followed by 35 cycles of 1 min 

at 94°C, 1 min at 56°C and 1 min at 72°C and a fina l elongation for 10 min at 72°C. 

Bacterial and fungal PCR reactions were checked by electrophoresis on a 1 % and 2 

%  agarose  gel,  respectively.  PCR  products  were  purified  using  the  MinElute  PCR 

purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Purified PCR products were quantified 

as above and 120 ng of purified PCR products were digested with 12 U of restriction 

enzyme in a final volume of 100 µl for 3 h at 37 °C . The restriction enzymes HaeIII 

(Promega) and MspI (Q-BIOgene) were used to digest 16S and 18S PCR products, 

Fluorescently-labelled  terminal  restriction  fragments  (TRF)  were  separated  and 
detected  using  a  capillary  electrophoresis  sequencer  CEQTM  2000XL  (Beckman 

Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Analyses were run with the Frag-4-30s-70min method, 

respectively. 

 132

Chapter 4 – Microbial communities in the geocaulosphere of potato 

including a denaturation of 2 min at 90°C, an injec tion at 2000 V during 30 s and a 

separation  at  4  800  V  during  70  min.  The  sizes  of  the  TRF  were  determined  by 

comparison  with  Size  Standard-600  (Beckman  Coulter).  Fungal  and  bacterial 

community  structures  were  characterised  by  the  size  and  fluorescence  intensity  of 

the  TRF.  For  each  PCR  product,  the  T-RFLP  analysis  was  performed  in  triplicate. 

Mean  values  for  the  relative  intensity  of  peaks  found  in  at  least  two  of  the  three 

analyses  were  considered  for  further  statistical  analyses  of  microbial  community 

structure. Moreover, the fragments between 60 to 640 bp corresponding to the size 

range  of  the  standard  were  considered.  The  comparison  of  the  TRF  sizes  between 

samples was automated by assigning them to discrete categories using the program 

Lis with an interval of 1.25 bp (Mougel et al., 2002). The communities characterized 

by the sizes of the TRF and their intensity measured by the height of the peaks were 

compared  by  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  using  the  ADE-4  software 

(Thioulouse et al., 1997). This ordination method summarizes multivariate data to a 

few  variables  or  dimensions  and  provides  an  arrangement  of  the  communities  in  a 

two-dimensional  diagram  based  on  their  scores  on  the  two  first  dimensions.  The 

significance  of  the  resulting  structures  was  checked  using  Monte  Carlo  tests  with  1 

000 random permutations of the data. 

Typing of microbial strains by T-RFLP 

In order to identify microorganisms corresponding to characteristic TRF in the 

geocaulosphere, diverse fungi previously isolated from potato tubers were analysed 

using  the  same  procedure  of T-RFLP  analysis  as  above.  As  Streptomyces  bacteria 

are  frequently  associated  to  potatoes  (Bouchek-Mechiche  et  al.,  1998),  their 

characteristic  TRF  was  also  determined  in  order  to  identify  them  in  bacterial 

community  structures.  Three  strains  of  Streptomyces  (S.  europeaiscabiei,  S. 

mirabilis,  S.  scabiei)  and  53  fungal  strains  belonging  to  27  different  genera  and  56 

species  were  used  (Fiers  et  al.,  2010).  The  strains  were  stored  in  the  collection 

"Microorganisms  of  Interest  for  Agriculture  and  Environment"  (MIAE,  INRA  Dijon, 

France). Strains of Streptomyces stored at 4°C on potato dextrose agar (PDA) were 
cultivated in 25 mL of Luria Bertani media (10 g L-1 of bacto tryptone, 5 g L-1 of yeast 
extract, 10 g L-1 of NaCl; pH 7) for 6 days at 27°C. The DNA was ext racted using the 

DNeasy  Blood  and  Tissue  kit 

(Qiagen)  according 

to 

the  manufacturer's 

133

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 4 – Microbial communities in the geocaulosphere of potato 

specifications.  The  DNA  quantity  and  quality  were  checked  by  electrophoresis  as 

above and the DNA concentrations calculated as above were between 6 and 650 ng 
µL-1. 

The  fungal  strains  were  cultivated  in  tubes  on  a  PDA  slope.  Two  mL  of  potato 

dextrose  broth  (PDB)  were  poured  into  each  tube.  Each  tube  was  then  vortexed  to 

disperse the spores, and the mixture was poured into Roux flasks containing 100 mL 

of  PDB.  For  fungi  which  do  not  sporulate  (i.e.  R.  solani),  6  explants  of  PDA  were 

directly placed into Roux flasks. Flasks were incubated at room temperature without 

shaking  for  2  to  3  days.  The  mycelium  was  harvested  by  filtration,  frozen  at  -80°C 

during 30 min, freeze dried and stored at -80°C. Th e mycelium was ground to powder 

with liquid nitrogen using cold sterile mortar and pestle. The DNA was extracted from 

20  mg  of  mycelium  powder  using  the  DNeasy  plant  mini  kit  (Qiagen).  The  DNA 

quantity  and  quality  were  checked  by  electrophoresis  on  a  0.8  %  agarose  gel, 

revealed  with  ethydium  bromide  and  visualized  by  UV  transillumination.  The  DNA 
concentrations  were  between  3.5  and  125  ng  µL-1.  The  T-RFLP  analysis  of  each 

strain was performed as above. 

Results 

Before haulm destruction (T1), 61 % of the tubers had blemishes. At this date, 

blemishes  were  light;  they  affected  about  1  %  of  the  tuber  surface.  The  most 

frequently  observed  blemishes  were  superficial  polygonal  lesions  (39  %),  star-like 

lesions  with  (5  %)  or  without  (9  %)  halo  and  netted  scab  (7%).  Other  blemishes 

represented  1 %.  After  haulm destruction  (T2),  86  % of the  tubers  were  blemished, 

52  %  presented  black  scurf  on  at  least  9  %  of  the  tuber  surface,  14  %  were 

blemished  by  star-like  lesions  with  halo  and  13  %  by  star-like  lesions  without  halo. 

Seven percents of the tubers presented netted scab (Figure 4.1).

T-RFLP analyses provided complex profiles for bacteria and fungi at each sampling 

time. The  mean number  of TRF  per  soil  sample  was  90 for  the  bacteria  and  37 for 

the fungi. PCA showed that inter-row soils were always different from samples from 

geocaulospheres  especially  at  T2  and  they  were  more  variable  at  T1  than  at  T2. 

There  were  as  much  differences  between  tubers  from  the  same  plant  as  between 

tubers  from  different  plants  (Figure  4.2).  At  T1,  the  permutation  tests  revealed  that 

the  bacterial  community  structures  were  not  different  whatever  the  sanitary  state  of 

the  tubers  (Figure  4.2a).  However,  at  T2  the  structures  of  the  bacterial  community 

differed  significantly  according  to  the  sanitary  status  of  the  tubers  (Figure  4.2c).

Concerning fungi, significant differences were observed at T1 between communities 

of  geocaulospheres  harbouring  healthy  potatoes  from  healthy  plants  and  potatoes 

from  partially-healthy  and  blemished  plants  (Figure  4.2b).  At  T2,  differences  were 

observed  between  the  communities  of  geocaulospheres  harbouring  blemished 

potatoes  from  blemished  plants  and  potatoes  from  partially-healthy  and  blemished 

plants  (Figure  4.2d).  The  structures  of  bacterial  communities,  respectively  fungal 

communities  in  soil  samples  around  healthy  and  blemished  tubers  from  partially-

healthy and blemished plants were always similar. However, they were different from 

the  structures  of  the  community  of  soil  samples  around healthy  tubers from  healthy 

plants  for  fungi  and  from  the  community  structures  of  soil  around  blemished  tubers 

from blemished plants, for bacteria and fungi.

A global analysis showed significant discrimination in bacterial community structures 

between  the  two  periods  of  sampling,  T1  and  T2  (Figure  4.3a).  However,  the 

permutation  test  did  not  show  significant  difference  between  the  community 

structures  around  blemished  tubers  from  blemished  plants  at  T2  and  around 

blemished 

tubers 

from  partially-blemished  plants  at  T1.  Among 

the  peaks 

representing  the  bacterial  TRF,  five  of  them  were  high  in  intensity  in  all  the 

treatments. One peak was intense only at T1, another was observed in all treatments 

except inter-row soils. Some peaks we only observed in inter-row soils. 

The  fungal  global  analysis  revealed  a  marked  discrimination  between  the  two 

samplings T1 and T2 (Figure 4.3b). For all treatments, three fungal TRF were among 

the peaks of highest intensity. The TRF of ~ 583 bp was intense (5.5 % of the relative 

intensity in mean) in all the treatments except in inter-row soil at T2. In addition to the 

three main peaks, seven dominant peaks were observed in soils sampled at T1 and 

in soils sampled at T2, but they were different for the two sampling dates. One of the 

seven  major  TRF  at  T2,  a  peak  around  565  bp,  was  particularly  intense  in  fungal 

community structures around blemished tubers from blemished plants at T1 and T2.

The  T-RFLP  analysis  of  reference  strains  revealed  that  the  three  species  of 

Streptomyces analyzed had about the same length of TRF with an average of 222.88 

bp. In soil community structures, peaks around 222 or 223 bp were not detected at 

T1  and  only  slightly  detected  at  T2.  Concerning  fungi,  the  species  from  the  same 

genus  have  about  the  same  TRF  length  except  for  Trichoderma  (Table  4.2).  The 

peaks  associated  with  Rhizopus  orzyae,  Verticillium  dahliae,  Absidia  glauca  and 

Fusidium griseum were never detected in soil communities. Among strains for which 

the  TRF  length  was  determined,  none  was  detected  in  soil  samples  from  healthy 

plants.  The  TRF  corresponding 

to  Macrophomina  phaseolina  (561.34  bp), 

Colletotrichum sp. (580.06 bp) and Cylindrocarpon olidum (580.10 bp) were detected 

in complex profiles of soil samples from partially-healthy and blemished plants only at 

T1.  The four  genera  Alternaria,  Ulocladium,  Phoma  and  Epicoccum  have  about  the 

same  TRF  length  (583.04  to  583.40  bp).  TRF  of  similar  length  were  detected  in  T-

RFLP profiles from partially-healthy and blemished plants at T1, all the treatment at 

T2, as well as in soil samples from inter-row at T1 and T2. The TRF of Penicillium sp. 

(558.56  bp),  Rhizoctonia  solani  (565.19  bp),  Trichoderma  sp.  (580.86  bp)  and 

Cladosporium cladosporioides (580.94 bp) were detected in complex T-RFLP profiles 

of  soil  samples  from  partially-healthy  and  blemished  plants  and  from  blemished 

plants at T1 and T2 but neither in geocaulosphere of healthy plants nor in inter-row 

soil. The same situation was observed for the TRF of Mortiella elongata but only at 

T2.  Bjerkandera  adusta  had a TRF  of  564.59  bp.  Such  length  was  only  detected  in 

inter-row soils at T2.

Discussion 

 

The  main  objective  of  the  present  study  was  to  investigate  whether  the 

microbial  community  structure  in  the  geocaulosphere  of  potato  tubers  depends  on 

the occurrence of blemishes on the tubers. In addition, although the same TRF may 

correspond to different microorganisms, the analysis of a collection of strains with the 

same  T-RFLP  procedure  can  provide  hypotheses  concerning  the  microorganisms 

responsible  for  the  variations  observed  in  community  structures.  The  occurrence  of 

blemished tubers observed before and after haulm destruction increased by 41 % in 

27 days and all the sclerotia appeared after haulm destruction.  

The community structures of inter-row soils were different at T1 and T2. The slightest 

variability  in  inter-row  soil  sampled  at T2  can  be  explained by  climatic  conditions  or 

by  a  drought  event  at  the  end  of  the  growing  season.  Inter-row  soils  were  also 

generally distinct from the soil samples from geocaulosphere. This was confirmed by 

141

 

Chapter 4 – Microbial communities in the geocaulosphere of potato 

the  fact  that  some  TRF  were  specifically  associated  with  inter-row  soil  samples. 

Thus,  non  cultivated  soils  had  different  microbial  community  structures  than  soils 

where  potatoes  were  grown.  This  implies  that  potato  plants  have  an  effect  on  the 

structure of the communities of their geocaulosphere, probably through phenological 

and  physiological  changes.  The  geocaulosphere 

is  an  evolving  and  alive 

environment  that  can  be  compared  with  the  rhizosphere  in  which  exudates  are 

produced and have an effect on their environment. 

Our study showed that the structures of microbial communities were homogeneous in 

the geocaulosphere of partially healthy and partially blemished plants. The microbial 

communities  of  healthy  plants  had  different  structures  compared  with  the  microbial 

communities of partially healthy and blemished plants, which were also different from 

the  microbial  community  structures  of  blemished  plants.  Therefore,  the  microbial 

communities evolved according to the sanitary status of the plant. 

The  data  showed  significant  differences  between  bacterial  community  structures 

before and after haulm destruction, especially among healthy tubers. In the case of 

healthy plants, the structure of the bacterial communities was different at T1 and T2, 

while  in  the  case  of  blemished  plants,  the  structure  of  the  bacterial  communities  in 

the  geocaulosphere  of  blemished  tubers  was  similar  at  T1  and  T2.  The  bacterial 

consortium  was  quite  different  for  healthy  tubers  from  healthy  plant  at  T1  and  for 

healthy  tubers  from  partially-healthy  plants  at  T2.  Conversely,  it  was  relatively 

homogenous and constant around blemished tubers from half blemished plant at T1 

and  blemished  tubers  from  blemished  plant  at  T2.  The  intermediate  states,  healthy 

tubers  from  partially-healthy  plant  at  T1  and  blemished  tubers  from  partially-

blemished plant at T2, had in-between bacterial community structures. There was a 

progressive evolution from two different structures of the bacterial communities at T1 

and  T2  around  healthy  tubers  toward  a  common  structure  around  all  blemished 

tubers. For fungi, the variations of community structures induced by time were higher 

than the variations induced by the health state of plants. The two distinct structures at 

T1 and T2 showed that there was a succession of the fungal communities in potato 

geocaulosphere along with time. Considering the analysis of the most intense peaks 

for  each  community,  the  differences  of  structures  between  T1  and  T2  were  much 

more marked for fungi than for bacteria. We observed that the main fungal TRF were 

very different at T1 and T2, whereas the most intense bacterial TRF were the same 

at  T1  and  T2.  The  distinction  between  T1  and  T2  is  not  only  due  to  the  time  delay 

 142

Chapter 4 – Microbial communities in the geocaulosphere of potato 

between the two sampling dates. Although the weather report for 2008 showed that 

July and August had about the same climatic conditions in France, the physiological 

variations of plants and the impact of chemical products applied for haulm destruction 

on the microbial community structures should also be considered. 

Data about the TRF lengths of reference strains could have allowed a more precise 

analysis of the complex soil profiles. Although some TRF provided information about 

the occurrence of putative fungal species in the geocaulosphere, the majority of the 

peaks in complex T-RFLP profiles could not have been associated with a particular 

species  or  genera.  Although 

the  T-RFLP  analyses  were  performed  on  a 

representative  sample  of  microorganisms  living  on  the  surface  of  the  potato  tubers 

(Fiers  et  al.,  2010),  only  few  microorganisms  could  be  allocated  to  the  main  peaks 

observed  for  each  profile.  Moreover,  our  analysis  could  not  determine  the  TRF 

lengths  of  some  species  because  they  were  longer  than  640  bp,  the  maximal 

detectable  length  with  the  size  standard  that  was  used.  TRF  data  remain  rare  and 

databases  providing  information  on  the  TRF  lengths  of  various  microorganism 

species could be an interesting tool allowing a more precise analysis of complex T-

RFLP profiles. Several papers report works on databases development, but sources 

of  error  remain  possible  and  existing  databases  are  still  poor  concerning 

environmental microorganisms (Matsumoto et al., 2005; Dickie and FitzJohn, 2007). 

In our results, it appeared that all the determined TRF were not present in complex T-

RFLP profiles. TRF corresponding to TRF of R. orzyae, V. dahliae, A. glauca and F. 

griseum were not detected in any of the soil samples. Those fungi were absent from 

the  geocaulosphere  of  the  studied  potatoes.  The  strains  analyzed,  isolated  from 

blemished tubers were never detected in the geocaulosphere of healthy tubers. This 

shows  that  those  strains  were  specifically  associated  to  the  geocaulospheres  of 

blemished  tubers.  It  also  happened  that  several  genera  had  the  same  TRF  length. 

This  was  the  case  for  the  ~  583  bp  TRF  which  matched  at  least  with  four  different 

genera:  Alternaria,  Ulocladium,  Phoma  and  Epicoccum,  and  for  the  ~  580  bp  TRF 

which  matched  with  Colletotrichum  and  Cylindrocarpon  genera.  Among  the  most 

intense  peaks  observed  in  soil  community  structures,  some  could  correspond  to 

some  of  the  strains  that  were  analysed.  For  example,  the  TRF  of  ~  565  bp 

represented 5 % in average of the total intensity of each complex profile. This length 

corresponds to the mean TRF of R. solani. This fungal species or a fungus with the 

same  TRF  length  was  highly  present  in  the  geocaulosphere  of  blemished  potato 

 

 

143

Chapter 4 – Microbial communities in the geocaulosphere of potato 

tubers after haulm destruction (T2). This coincided with the period of time that black 

scurf  was  first  observed on blemished  tubers  in  the experimental field.  As  we  know 

that  black  scurf  is  caused  by  R.  solani  forming  sclerotia,  at  the  tuber  surface  (El 

Bakali and Martin, 2006), we can confirm that this particularly intense TRF of ~ 565 

bp  corresponded  to  R.  solani.  This  is  in  agreement  with  the  previous  results 

indicating  that  sclerotia  are  formed  after  haulm  destruction  (Otrysko  et  al.,  1988). 

Likewise,  TRF  of  ~  581  bp  could  correspond  to  Trichoderma  sp.  This  TRF 

represented 10.7 % of the total intensity of the T-RFLP profile of inter-row soil at T2. 

Another  peak  representing  10  %  of  the  total  intensity  of  the  profile  of  blemished 

tubers  at  T2  was  583  bp  long.  This  TRF  could  be  associated  to  Alternaria, 

Ulocladium,  Phoma  or  Epicoccum.  Trichoderma  spp.,  Alternaria  spp.,  Ulocladium 

spp.,  Phoma  spp.  and  Epicoccum  spp.  are  not  pathogenic  for  potatoes;  however, 

they  are  good  saprophytes  and  can  easily  develop  in  soil.  Alternaria  spp.  were 

particularly associated with blemished tubers (Fiers et al., 2010), probably because it 

takes advantage of the niche created by the blemish formation. The bacterial TRF of 

~  222  bp  was  detected  in  some  inter-row  soil  samples.  This  TRF  length  can  be 

associated to the TRF of Streptomyces, a potentially pathogenic bacterium of potato 

causing netted scab, observed on some of the analyzed tubers. 

As just demonstrated, the fungal community structures of the geocaulosphere 

of potato tuber evolve by succession of different fungal community structures in time. 

The  apparition  of  a  R.  solani  population  around  blemished  tubers  after  haulm 

destruction  is  the  only  case  for  which  a  causality  link  between  the  presence  of  this 

fungus and the occurrence of specific blemishes can be proposed (Fiers et al., 2010). 

For  the  other  microorganisms,  it  is  so  far  difficult  to  conclude  whether  the 

modification of the structure of their communities has provided conditions for, or was 

a consequence of the occurrence of blemishes, but this study clearly demonstrates a 

direct relationship between these simultaneous events.

Abstract 

The soil borne fungus Rhizoctonia solani is a pathogen for many plants and causes 

severe  damages  in  crops  all  around  the  world.  Strains  of  R.  solani  from  the 

anastomosis group (AG) 3 attack potatoes that lead to great yield losses and to the 

downgrading of the production. The study of the genetic diversity of the strains of R. 

solani in France allows determining the structure of the populations and establishing 

adapted  control  strategies  against  this  pathogen.  The  diversity  of  73  French  strains 

isolated from tubers grown in the mains potato seed production areas and 31 strains 

isolated in 9 other countries was assessed by phylogenetic analyses of i) the internal 

transcribed spacer sequences (ITS1 and ITS2)) of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), ii) a part 
of  the  gene  tef-1α  and  iii)  the  total  DNA  fingerprints  of  each  strain  established  by 

amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). The determination of the AGs of R. 

solani based on the sequencing of the ITS region showed 3 different AGs among our 

collection (60 AG 3 PT, 8 AG 2-1 and 5 AG 5). Grouping of the strains belonging to 
the same AG was confirmed by the sequencing of the gene tef-1α used for the first 

time to study the genetic diversity of R. solani. About 42 % of the ITS sequences and 
73  %  of  the  gene  tef-1α  sequences  contained  polymorphic  sites  where  several 

nucleotides are possible, suggesting that the cells of R. solani strains contain several 
copies  of  ITS  and  gene  tef-1α  within  the  same  nucleus  or  between  different  nuclei. 
Phylogenetic trees showed a greater genetic diversity within AGs in tef-1α sequences 

than in ITS sequences. The AFLP analyses showed an even greater diversity among 

the strains demonstrating that the French strains of R. solani isolated from potatoes 

were  not  a  clonal  population.  Moreover,  there  was  no  relationship  between  the 

geographical  origins  of  the  strains  or  the  variety  from  which  they  were  isolated  and 

their genetic diversity.

Introduction 

The  fungus  Rhizoctonia  solani  (teleomoph  Thanatephorus  cucumeris,  Kühn, 

1858) is a widely spread plant pathogen which cause severe damages on numerous 

plant  species.  R.  solani  includes  many  related  but  genetically  different  subspecific 

groups.  The  hyphae  of  the  closely  related  strains  can  fuse  and,  hence,  form  an 

anastomosis  group  (AG),  whereas  the  distantly  related  strains  are  unable  to 

anastomose (Parmeter, 1970; Kuninaga and Yokosawa, 1984; Carling et al., 2002). 

The  known  strains  of  R.  solani  can  be  classified  into  at  least  13  AGs,  but  the 

classification  is  not  strictly  fixed  as  some  'bridging  strains'  are  able  to  anastomose 

with strains of at least two AGs (Parmeter, 1970; Carling et al., 2002; Sharon et al., 

2008).  Each  AG  is  either  host  specific  or  with  a  wide  host  range  (Ogoshi,  1987; 

Carling  et  al.,  2002).  For  example,  AG  2  is  associated  with  diverse  host  plants  but 

AG 8 is more specifically associated with cereals. AG 3 is divided into two genetically 

different  subgroups:  AG  3  PT  which  is  associated  with  potatoes,  and  AG  3  TB, 

associated with tobacco (Kuninaga et al., 2000; Woodhall et al., 2008). R. solani AG 

3  PT  reduces  tuber  quality  by  producing  sclerotia  (black  scurf)  on  progeny  potato 

tubers. The pathogen can also infect underground organs (stems, stolons and roots) 

which affect crop yield (tuber size and number) (El Bakali and Martin, 2006). Beside 

those  typical  symptoms,  R.  solani  is  associated  with  several  types  of  blemishes  on 

potato tubers (Fiers et al., 2010). Other AGs of R. solani are sometimes considered 

as potential pathogens of potato in France and in the United Kingdom, although the 

Koch's  postulates  have  still  not  been  assessed  (Campion  et  al.,  2003;  Woodhall  et 

al., 2008). 

The  AG  differentiation  is  traditionally  carried  out  by  pairing  unknown  isolates  with 

reference  strains  and  by  identification  of  the  hyphal  anastomosis  reaction  (Carling, 

1996;  Guillemaut  et  al.,  2003).  However,  this  method  is  time  consuming,  needs 

experienced  eyes  and  does  not  show  the  diversity  among  AGs.  Sequencing  of  the 

internal  transcribed  spacer  (ITS)  of  the  ribosomal  DNA  (rDNA)  is  now  a  more 

convenient  and  rapid  method  to  differentiate  R.  solani  AG.  However  this  region  is 

less variable for detection of differences between isolates of the same AG (Kuninaga 
et al., 2000; Woodhall et al., 2007; Lehtonen et al., 2008b). The gene tef-1α encoding 

the  translation  elongation  factor  1α  and  more  variable  than  the  ITS  region  has 

already  proved  its  usefulness  to  reveal  genetic  variability  within  fungal  genera, 

 

151

Chapter 5 – Genetic diversity of Rhizoctonia solani associated with potato  

including Fusarium (Geiser et al., 2004) and Trichoderma (Anees et al., 2010b). This 

genetic marker could be useful to reflect polymorphism both between and within AG 

of  R.  solani.  In  addition  to  targeted  DNA  markers,  strategies  based  on  amplified 

fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) allow a large number of DNA fragments to be 

screened  in  order  to  assess  intraspecific  variability  to  differentiate  closely  related 

isolates and reveal clonal lineages (McDonald, 1997).  

The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic diversity of isolates of R. solani 

collected  from  the  different  potato-growing  areas  in  France.  The  genetic  variability 
between  and  within  AG  was  evaluated  using  ITS  and  tef-1α  sequencing,  together 

with AFLP analysis. 

Material and methods 

A  collection  of  73  isolates  of  R.  solani  was  collected  from  potato  tubers  of 

several  varieties  and from  9  different  French  departments producing  potato  in  2006 

and  2007  (TABLE  18).  The  potato  tubers  were  affected  by  various  superficial 

blemishes  (Fiers  et  al.,  2010).  In  addition,  31  isolates  of  R.  solani  from  other 

countries  were  analyzed:  6  from  Finland,  1  from  Germany,  1  from  Japan,  4  from 

Morocco, 1 from the Netherlands, 2 from Poland, 1 from Spain, 12 from Switzerland, 

and 3 from the United Kingdom (Table 5.1). 

DNA  of  all  the  fungal  isolates  was  extracted  from  freeze  dried  powder  of  mycelium 

using the DNeasy plant mini kit according to the protocol previously described (Fiers 

et al., 2010).

For each fungal isolate, the ITS region of the rDNA and part of the tef-1α gene were 

amplified  by  PCR. 

ITS  PCR  was  performed  with 

the  primers 

ITS1-F 

(CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS4 (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) (White 

et  al.,  1990;  Gardes  and  Bruns,  1993)  in  a  final  volume  of  50  µL  by  mixing  2  µl  of 

DNA with 0.5 µM of each primer, 150 µM of dNTP, 6 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Q-
Biogen,  Evry,  France)  and  PCR  reaction  buffer.  PCR  amplifications  of  tef-1α  were 

performed  with  primers  EF1–645F  (TCG  TCG  TYA  TCG  GMC  ACG  TCG  A)  and 

EF1–1190R (TAC CAG TGA TCA TGT TCT TGA TGA) (Andersen et al., 2009) in a 

final  volume  of  25  µL  by  mixing  1  µL  DNA  with  0.068  µM  of  each  primer,  1.5  mM 

MgCl2, 150 µM dNTP, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Q-Biogen, Evry, France) and PCR 

reaction  buffer.  Amplifications  were  conducted  in  a  mastercycler  (Eppendorf, 

Hambourg, Germany). ITS amplification consisted in an initial denaturation of 3 min 

at 94 C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 C, 1 min at 50 C, 1 min at 72 C, and a 
final extension of 10 min at 72 C. Amplification of tef-1α was carried out with an initial 

denaturation of 5 min at 94 C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 C, 30 s at 52 C, 

and 80  s  at  72  C and  a final  extension  of 7  min  at 72  C. Aliquots  of  PCR  products 

were  checked  by  electrophoresis  on  a  1  %  agarose  gel,  revealed  with  ethydium 

bromide and visualized by UV trans-illumination. 
ITS  and  tef-1α  PCR  products  were  sequenced  by  Beckman  Coulters  Genomics 

(Takeley,  UK)  using  primers  ITS1-F  and  ITS4  and  EF1-645F  and  EF1-1190R, 

respectively.  For  each  PCR  product,  sequences from  both  strands  were  assembled 

to  produce  a  consensus  sequence  using  the  software  SeqMan  (DNASTAR 

Lasergene, GATC Biotech SARL, Marseille, France). The identities of the sequences 

were determined using BLAST analyses from the National Center for Biotechnology 

Information (NCBI) available on line. For each DNA region, sequences were aligned 

using  ClustalX  (Thompson  et  al.,  1997).  The  multiple  sequence  alignments  were 

carried out with PHYLO-WIN (Galtier et al., 1996) using the Kimura's two parameters 

distance  model  (Kimura,  1980)  and  the  neighbor-joining  method  (Saitou  and  Nei, 

1987). The  topology  of  the  resulting  tree  was  tested by  bootstrapping  with  1000  re-

samplings  of  the  data.  Phylogenetic  trees  were  drawn  using  the  NJPLOT  program 

(Perrière and Gouy, 1996).

The digestion and ligation of 125 ng of extracted DNA were carried out according to 

the manufacturer's  specifications of  the  AFLP  Core  Reagent  kit  (Invitrogen)  (Vos  et 

al., 1995). The ligation products were pre-amplified by PCR. PCR amplifications were 

performed in a final volume of 25.5 µL by mixing 2.5 µL of DNA with 0.3 µM of each 

primer E-0 (GACTGCGTACCAATTC) and M-0 (GATGAGTCCTGAGTAA), 212 µM of 

dNTP,  2.5  U  of  Taq  DNA  polymerase  (Q-Biogen,  Evry,  France)  and  PCR  reaction 

buffer. Amplification was conducted in a thermal cycler GeneAmp PCR system 9600 

(Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) with 20 cycles of 30 s at 94 C, 

1 min at 56 C, and 1 min at 72 C. A 1:50 dilution was performed with 1.5 µL of pre-

amplified product diluted in 73.5 µL TE buffer. Selective amplification was performed 

in  a  final  volume  of  20  µL  by  mixing  5  µL  of  DNA  with  0.4  µM  of  E-AA  5′-IRD800 

fluorescent  primer  (GACTGCGTACCAATTCAA)  (MWG),  0.30  µM  of  M-C  primer 

(GATGAGTCCTGAGTAAC), 202.5 µM of dNTP, 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Q-

Biogen) and PCR reaction buffer. PCR was conducted in a thermal cycler GeneAmp 

PCR system 9600 with a first cycle at 94 C during 30 s, 65 C during 30 s, and 72 C 

during  1  min.  The  12  following  cycles  were  performed  by  reducing  the  annealing 

temperature of 0.7 C at each cycle. Then, 23 cycles were performed at 94 C during 

30  s,  56  C  during  30  s,  and  72  C  during  1  min.  Aliquots  of  PCR  products  were 

checked  by  electrophoresis  on  a  1  %  agarose  gel,  revealed  with  ethydium  bromide 

and  visualized  by  UV  trans-illumination.  Separation  of  the  amplified  fragments  was 

performed on a 41 cm polyacrylamide gel (Li-Cor, Germany) with 6.5 % acrylamide 

KB (Li-Cor), during 10h30 at 1 500 V for a resolution of the fragments from 50 to 700 

bp. A size standard (50-700 bp sizing standard, Li-Cor) and a strain of reference for 

which the profile is known, were added on each gel in at least five wells. A picture of 

each gel was taken. For each strain, the analysis  was performed in duplicates from 

independent DNA extracts. 

Li-Cor  gel  pictures  were  analyzed  with  ONE-Dscan  software  (Scanalytics  BD 

Biosciences-Bioimaging,  version  2.05),  measuring  the  band  sizes  of  the  115  most 

intense  bands  between  100  and  500  bp  for  each  profile.  Categories  grouping 

fragments,  whose  weight  differed  by  less  than  1.5  bp,  were  created  with  LisAFLP 

program (Mougel et al., 2002). The LecPCR application (ADE-4 v. 2001 Thioulouse 

et  al.,  1997)  was  then  applied  to  the  data  to  transform  the  fragment  weights  matrix 

into  a  binary  matrix.  The  binary  matrix  indicated  the  absence  (0) or  presence  (1) of 

 156

Chapter 5 – Genetic diversity of Rhizoctonia solani associated with potato  

 
 
each  fragment  for  each  profile.  Finally,  only  fragments  present  in  the  two  repeats 

performed  for  each  strain  were  included  in  the  analysis.  Genetic  relationships 

between each profile was estimated using the Nei and Li similarity index (Nei and Li, 

1979) and bootstrap values corresponding to the appearance frequency of branches 

in  1000  data  permutations  was  calculated  with  Treecon  software  (Vandepeer  and 

Dewachter,  1994  version  1.3b).  The  similarity  matrix  was  represented  by  a 

dendrogram  with  the  UPGMA  (unweighted  pair  grouping  method  with  arithmetic 

mean) algorithm (Sneath and Sokal, 1973).  

 

 

 

Results 

PCR amplification of the ITS region with the primers ITS1-F and ITS 4 gave a 

single product of approximately 700 bp for each isolate. The ITS1, 5.8S and the ITS2 

regions  were  sequenced  for  100  isolates  (Table  5.1).  For  all  isolates,  BLAST 

analyses  allowed  to  determine  the  corresponding  AG  on  the  basis  of  99  to  100  % 

sequence  similarity  with  corresponding  sequences.  Among  the  73  French  isolates, 

60 were identified as R. solani AG 3 PT, the remaining were AG 2-1 (8 isolates) and 

AG  5  (5  isolates).  A  total  of  64  polymorphic  sites  was  identify  in  ITS1  but  only  24 

polymorphic sites in ITS2. Among the large number of AG 3 PT isolates analyzed, 10 

and  3  variable  sites  were  observed  in  ITS1  and  ITS2,  respectively  (Figure  5.1). 

Heterogeneity  within  isolates  was  observed  for  48  out  of  the  100  isolates.  This 

heterogeneity  was  observed  as  two  overlapping  peaks  at  the  same  position  in  the 

electrophoregram,  indicating  that  multiple  ITS  types  might  exist  within  isolates. 

Among  the AG  3 PT  sequences,  this  heterogeneity  within  isolates  was  observed  at 

all the 13 variable sites identified within the AG. Conversely, only 2 and 4 sites were 

identified  to  be  polymorphic  within  isolates  among  AG  2-1  and  AG  5  sequences; 

however the number of sequences was also lower with 11 and 6 isolates from AG 2-

1 and AG 5, respectively. 

All  the  sequences  were  assigned  to  a  type  number  from  m1  to  m10  for  the  10 

monomorphic  sequences  observed  and  p1  to  p29  for  the  29  sequences  with 

polymorphic  sites,  coded  as  m  and  p  followed  by  a  number  designate  the  different 

monomorphic  and  polymorphic  sequence 

types, 

respectively 

(Figure  5.1).

Comparisons  of  all  sequences  allowed  identifying  39  ITS  types.  Four  types  were 

identified within AG 2-1 (type m1, m2, p1, p2), 33 within AG 3 PT (type m3 – m9 and 

type p3 – p28) and 2 within AG 5 (type m10 and p29) (Table 5.1). 

The  52  sequences  without  any  polymorphic  site  were  compared  in  a  phylogenetic 

tree (Figure 5.2). The three AG were genetically different as they appeared on three 

distinct  branches  of  the  tree  with  significant  bootstrap  values  above  99  %.  Isolates 

belonging to AG 5 were more similar to isolates from AG 2-1 than to isolates from AG 

3  PT  (Figure  5.2).  The  tree  of  ITS  sequences  showed  7  different  ITS  types  among 

AG 3 PT. Type m3 comprised one isolate (MIAE00267) from France (Côtes d'Armor) 

and  isolated  from  cultivar  Charlotte.  Type  m5  included  12  isolates  from  France 

(Finistère,  Eure-et-Loir,  Pas-de-Calais).  They  were  isolated  from  cultivar  Spunta, 

Samba, Pamela, Chérie, Amandine, Hermes and Juliette. ITS type m4 comprised 11 

isolates  from  France  (Finistère,  Morbihan,  Côtes  d'Armor),  Switzerland  and  United 

Kingdom.  They  were  isolated  from  cultivars  Charlotte,  Juliette,  Atlas,  Gourmandine, 

and  Bellini.  Type  m7  included  4  isolates  all  from  France  (Finistère)  isolated  from 

cultivar Samba or a hybrid. The ITS types m6, m8 and m9 were grouped in the same 

branch,  distantly  related  from  the  other  types  in  AG  3  PT.  Type  m6  comprised  5 

isolates from France (Finistère) and United Kingdom isolated from cultivars Charlotte 

and  Juliette.  Type  m8  comprised  2  isolates  from  France  (Finistère)  isolated  from 

cultivars Spunta and Bintje. Type m9 comprised 3 isolates from Poland and France 

(Finistère) isolated from Urgenta and unknown cultivars. 

Two different ITS types were observed among AG 2-1. Type m2 included 7 isolates 

from France (Somme) and United Kingdom. They were isolated from a hybrid cultivar 

and  an  unknown  cultivar.  Type  m1  included  2  isolates  from  Finland  and  France 

(Côtes  d'Armor)  and  they  were  isolated  from  an  unknown  cultivar  and  cultivar 

Juliette. Finally, monomorphic isolates from AG 5 were grouped in only one ITS type 

(m10). They were 5 isolates from France (Eure-et-Loir, Lot-et-Garonne) and Finland 

isolated from cultivars Chérie, Samba, a hybrid and an unknown cultivar.

Figure  5.2  Neighbour-joining  tree  (Kimura  two-parameter  distance)  of  52  monomorphic  ITS 
sequences of Rhizoctonia solani isolated from potato tubers.  
Bootstrap values (≥ 60 %) are shown near the equivalent branches. 
 
The PCR amplification of the tef-1α gene with the primers EF1-645F and EF1-1190R 
gave a single product of approximately 400 bp. The tef-1α gene was sequenced for 

86  isolates  (Table  5.1).  In  BLAST  analyses,  all  sequences  matched  a  sequence  of 

the  same  AG  of  R.  solani  than  the  AG  identified  through  ITS  sequence,  with  a 

similarity of 93 to 100 %. Among the 86 sequenced isolates 13 belonged to AG 2-1, 

68 to AG 3 PT and 5 to AG 5.  
A  total  of  60  variable  sites  were  identified  among  tef-1α  sequences  (Figure  5.3). 

Among the 68 sequences of AG 3 PT, 20 variable sites were depicted. Among AG 2-

1 and AG 5 isolates, 42 and 8 variable sites were observed, respectively. Like in the 

ITS sequences, some heterogeneity within isolates was observed for 64 isolates out 
of the 86, such as polymorphic sites, which revealed polymorphism within the tef-1α 

gene  in  the  same  individual.  This  heterogeneity  was  observed  at  17,  14  and  5 

variable  sites  observed  within  AG  3  PT,  AG  2-1  and  AG  5  sequences,  respectively

Chapter 5 – Genetic diversity of Rhizoctonia solani associated with potato  

 
 
(Figure  5.3).  According  to  the  variations  in  the  tef-1α  sequences,  37  different 

elongation factor types were identified: 7 within AG 2-1 (types m1 – m3 and types p1- 

p4), 28 within AG 3 PT (type m4 – m7 and type p5 – p28) and 2 within AG 5 (type 

p29 and p30) (Table 5.1). 
A phylogenetic tree was built up on the basis of the 23 tef-1α sequences without any 

polymorphic  site,  together  with  one  sequence  of  AG  5  (MIAE00279)  including  only 

one  polymorphic  site.  Indeed  all  the  sequences  of  R.  solani  AG  5  analyzed 

comprised at least one polymorphic site (Figure 5.4). The phylogenetic tree showed 4 

different  elongation  factor  types  within  AG  3  PT.  Type  m6  comprised  one  isolate 

(MIAE00351)  from  Japan;  type  m5  comprised  7  isolates  from  France  (Finistère), 

Switzerland  and  Finland  isolated  from  cultivar  Spunta,  Samba,  Naviga  and  Bellini. 

Type  m4  comprised  9  isolates  from  different  department  of  France  (Côtes  d'Armor, 

Finistère  and  Loiret)  isolated  from  cultivars  Atlas,  Bintje,  Charlotte,  Juliette,  Spunta 

and Urgenta. Finally type m7 included 2 isolates from Poland isolated from unknown 
cultivars. All the strains belonging to the type m7 in tef-1α analysis corresponded to 

type  m9  in  ITS  analysis;  both  being  distantly  related  to  other  AG  3  PT  sequences 

(Figures 5.2 and 5.4). Among AG 2-1 sequences, three elongation factor types m1, 

m2 and m3 were identified.  
Combined data from ITS sequences and tef-1α sequences revealed a total of 59 two-

locus  sequence  types  among  the  82  isolates  for  which  both  loci  were  analyzed 

(Table  5.1).  Among  the  59  types,  only  10  two-locus  sequence  types  were 

monomorphic for both loci.

Eighty-nine  isolates  were  analyzed  by  the  AFLP  method.  The  number  of  bands 

analyzed (from 100 to 500 bp) was 60 – 102 per profile, with an average of 78 bands, 

for  a  total  of  254  useful  markers.  The  phylogenetic  tree  of  AFLP  profiles  showed 

three groups supported by significant bootstrap values above 96 %, corresponding to 

the  three  AGs  (Figure  5.5).  Regarding  AFLP  profiles,  the  AG  5  isolates  were  more 

related to the AG 3 PT isolates than to the AG 2-1 isolates, as it was shown on the 
tree of tef-1α sequences. A significant diversity was observed within each AG with so 

many  AFLP  profiles  as  isolates,  but  no  particular  clusters  could  be  identified  within 

AGs. Among AG 3 PT isolates, the French isolates were spread all over the tree. At a 

smaller scale, isolates originating from the same French Department (Finistère) were 

also found all along the tree, showing no direct relation of the diversity observed with 

the geographic origin.

Discussion 

 

In this study, 104 isolates of R. solani, all sampled from blemished potato tubers, 
were characterized by sequencing of the ITS region and part of the tef-1α gene and 

by  AFLP  fingerprinting.  The  73  French  isolates  were  representative  of  all  area 

producing potatoes in France; they were compared with 31 isolates originating from 

other countries. AG 3 PT was found to be predominant, including 82 % of the French 

isolates.  The  remaining  isolates  belonged  to  AG  2-1  and  AG  5.  R.  solani  isolates 

belonging  to  AG  3  are  frequently  isolated  from  potato  tubers  and  are  known  to  be 

pathogens for this crop (Kuninaga et al., 2000), but AG 2-1 and AG 5 are more rarely 

isolated 

from  blemished 

tubers  and 

their  pathogenicity  has  still  not  been 

demonstrated (Campion et al., 2003; Woodhall et al., 2008; Fiers et al., 2010).  
Several distinct types of the ITS region and of the tef-1α gene were identified among 

the  R.  solani  isolates and  surprisingly,  in  the  majority  of  isolates  the  coexistence  of 
multiple types was observed. Polymorphism in the ITS region and tef-1α gene within 

isolates can be due to the existence of different ribosomal DNA units within the same 

nucleus or different sequences in different nuclei. This hypothesis could be confirmed 

after  cloning  (Justesen  et  al.,  2003).  This  heterogeneity  results  from  mutations  that 

would  be  fixed.  Several  ITS  sequence  types  within  the  same  individual  were  also 

identified  for  other  fungi  such  as  Sclerotium  spp.  (Almeida  et  al.,  2001),  Ascochyta 

spp.  (Fatehi  and  Bridge,  1998)  and  Botrytis  spp.  (Yohalem  et  al.,  2003).  Among  R. 

solani populations, ITS polymorphism was studied within AG 2-1 and AG 3 (Justesen 

et  al.,  2003;  Pannecoucque  and  Hofte,  2009).  The  same  10  within-isolates 

polymorphic  sites  previously  identified  by  Justesen  et  al  (2003)  among  ITS1 

sequences  of  R.  solani  AG  3  were  also  detected  in  our  study  in  addition  to  others 

sites. The finding of two different ITS types or elongation factor types within the same 

isolate and the possible association with two different nuclear types is consistent with 

the  heterokaryotic  nature  of  R.  solani  which  has  been  confirmed  by  other  DNA 

marker methods that revealed heterozygosity in isolates of R. solani AG 3 (Ceresini 

et al., 2007). 
Both  loci,  ITS  region  and  tef-1α  gene,  showed  a  considerable  level  of  variability 

among R. solani isolates. Concerning the ITS region, we found that ITS1 sequences 

were much more variable than ITS2 sequences, with 24 % and 11 % of variable sites 

 

167

Chapter 5 – Genetic diversity of Rhizoctonia solani associated with potato  

 
 
in ITS1 and ITS2, respectively. Our results are in agreement with the ITS variability 

recently described by Nilsson et al (2008) among R. solani. The second locus used, 
tef-1α gene, was found even more polymorphic, with 27 % of variable sites among all 

three detected AGs of R. solani, and 9 % of variable sites among AG 3 PT isolates. 

However,  all  this  variability  could  not  be  illustrated  in  trees,  since  dimorphic  sites 

were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis. 

The different sequence types obtained for one DNA locus did not match exactly the 
sequence types obtained for the other locus. However, in both ITS and tef-1α trees, 

the AG 3 PT branch that diverged from other AG 3 PT sequences corresponded to 

the same isolates MIAE00354 and MIAE00355. 

The analysis of ITS sequences is a wide spread method for specific identifications of 
fungi and our results indicated that the gene tef-1α showed a greater diversity among 

AGs of R. solani than the ITS region. This shows the complementarity of sequences 

from two or more loci in multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approaches. Such MLST 

strategy  becomes  widely  used  to  resolve  phylogenetic  relationships  among  fungi 

such  as  Fusarium  (Nitschke  et  al.,  2009;  O'Donnell  et  al.,  2009)  or  Trichoderma 

(Kullnig-Gradinger  et  al.,  2002;  Anees  et  al.,  2010b).  These  recent  studies  have 
shown the interest of including tef-1α gene in such studies. However, the use of this 

gene to resolve genetic diversity  within R. solani has not been previously published 
and only 33 sequences of tef-1α gene of R. solani were available in Genbank before 

this  study.  We  used  primers  EF1-645F  and  EF1-1190R  originally  described  for 

Alternaria spp. (Andersen et al., 2009). We adapted PCR conditions to amplify part of 
the tef-1α gene from R. solani. Multigene approaches may be useful for more precise 

molecular  identifications  of  species or  AGs,  when  a  unique  locus such as  ITS  does 

not always provide clear information (Anees et al., 2010b). 
ITS and tef-1α types did not show any relationship with the geographical origin of the 

isolates  or  the  cultivar  of  origin.  Moreover,  AFLP  data  did  not  show  particular 

structure  among  the  isolates  belonging  to  the  same  AG.  Our  findings  support  the 

hypothesis  that  R.  solani  populations  are  constantly  always  evolving  following 

different  genetic  events.  The  absence  of  sporulation  of  R.  solani  may  limit  the 

dissemination  of  clonal  isolates  and  may  prevent  the  structuring  of  the  populations. 

On the other hand, the diversity of the R. solani populations could be enriched by the 

spread of the fungal genes taking place within the field and at larger extent, between 

 168

Chapter 5 – Genetic diversity of Rhizoctonia solani associated with potato  

 
 
French  departments  and  between  several  countries  separated  by  several  hundred 

kilometers. As tubers are exchanged on the international market, seed born inoculum 

could be the predominant cause of the long distance dispersal of the fungus. Indeed, 

potato 

tubers  are  vegetatively  multiplied  what 

increases 

the  risk  of  fungal 

transmission  through  infected  seed.  Therefore,  these  newly  introduced  genomes 

increase the diversity of the population by bringing in and exchanging genes with the 

endemic isolates. 

Despite  the  large  diversity  at  the  intraspecific  level  within  R.  solani,  no  evident 

relationship  between  cultivars  and  associated  populations  of  R.  solani  could  have 

been  depicted.  Since  there  is  no  difference  of  pathogenicity  between  isolates  of  R. 

solani  (Fiers  et  al.,  2010),  it  seems  that  the severity  of  the  disease  depends mainly 

on environmental conditions and perhaps on the behavior of the cultivar. This aspect 

of the plant – pathogen interaction was not previously studied in depth.  

Our study is the first evidence of genetic variability among R. solani associated with 

blemished  potato  tubers  in  France.  However,  the  genetic  diversity  of  R.  solani 

populations isolated from blemished tubers is neither dependant on the geographical 

origin of the isolates or on the host cultivar. The lack of population structure suggests 

a constant evolution within R. solani. Such evolution should be promoted by frequent 

genetic  events,  genetic  mixing  and  anthropogenic  activities.  Further  researches  are 

needed to determine the phenotypical characteristics of the isolates in order to set up 

adapted control strategies against R. solani.

Abstract 

blemishes. 

Potato  production  can  be  downgraded  because  of  blemishes  on  the  surface  of  the 

tubers  that  causes  severe  economical  losses.  These  blemishes  are  either  from 

known origin, they are called typical blemishes, either from unknown origin, they are 

called  atypical  blemishes.  Environmental factors  can  enhance  or  reduce  blemishes. 

This  study  dealt  with  the  abiotic  factors  that  could  impact  the  occurrence  of  the 

A survey was conducted with 45 potato seed producers in France. Physico-chemical 

traits of the soil, cultural practices and climatic conditions were evaluated in relation 

with the occurrence of the blemishes. Chi square tests (α = 0.05) established positive 

correlations between  soil  pH  belonging  to  the  6-7  class and  atypical  blemishes and 

between a dehaulming - harvesting delay longer than 40 days and potato scabs. The 

number of sclerotia was also greater when the rotation was shorter than 5 years and 

when the amount of water received by the crop during the growing season was lower 

than  350  mm.  In  addition,  a  statistical  study  about  the  varietal  susceptibility  toward 

superficial blemishes was carried out. A collection of 204 blemished tubers from 55 

different  varieties  was  analysed  by  factorial  correspondence  analysis.  Comparisons 

with the binomial law allowed showing particular susceptibility of Amandine variety to 

enlarged  lenticels  and  Spunta  variety  to  atypical  blemishes,  for  two  consecutive 

years.  

Our results showed that superficial blemish occurrences depended on abiotic factors 

and that some potato varieties are particularly susceptible to some blemishes. Abiotic 

factors  may  also  impact  biotic  ones  which  enhances  blemish  formation.  Integrated 

management of soil characteristics, cultural practices and the choice of the varieties 

are of major importance to control blemishes on the surface of potato tubers and to 

warranty the good cosmetic quality of the production.

Introduction 
 

Potato tuber quality is a predominant aspect of the potato production but can 

be  altered  by  numerous  damages  essentially  due  to  pathogenic  attacks.  Indeed, 

about  40  different  diseases  caused  by  fungi,  bacteria,  nematodes  or  viruses  may 

damage  potato  crop  all  around  the  world.  Quality  of  potato  tubers  may  also  be 

changed  by  environmental  conditions  due  to  natural  phenomena  -  high  soil 

temperature  is  responsible  for  heat  necrosis  in  vascular  ring  tissues  (Stevenson  et 

al.,  2001)  -  or  anthropogenic  activities  –  mechanic  harvesting  and  grading  induce 

damages  on  tubers  (Peters,  1996).  Knowledge  about  the  causes  of  the  different 

kinds  of  tuber  quality  problems  is  generally  proportional  to  the  economical 

importance of the damages.  

Potato  blemishes  are  superficial  alterations  of  the  tubers  that  alter  only  the  upper 

layers of the periderm (Fiers et al., submitted). Very few studies are available on the 

subject  because  blemishes  became  only  recently  an  important  economical  issue 

(Campion  et  al.,  2003;  Woodhall  et  al.,  2008).  A  few  years  ago  potatoes  were  not 

washed  before  being  sold  so,  the  superficial  blemishes  were  hidden  by  the  soil 

adhering to the tubers and thus, they were not considered as a problem. In the 80's, 

the habits of consumers began to change and tubers were washed to present "clean" 

products  on  the  store shelves.  Since then,  blemished  tubers  were downgraded  and 

the economical losses became more and more important. Although blemishes were 

observed since a long time (Peters, 1966; Hart, 1971), researches to determine their 

causes only began in the 2000's. Several hypotheses were proposed about the origin 

of  the  blemishes.  The  soil-borne  fungus  Rhizoctonia  solani  was  supposed  to  be 

predominantly involved in the occurrence of some superficial blemishes but not all of 

them (Campion et al., 2003; Woodhall et al., 2008). Environmental stresses such as 

high soil temperature, proximity of decaying organic matter, excessive moisture etc. 

were  also  assumed  to  be  responsible  for  the  visual  alterations  of  the  tubers 

(Stevenson  et  al.,  2001;  Sexton,  2003;  Selman  et  al.,  2008)  but  a  clear 

demonstration  of  the  respective  involvement  of  biotic  and  non  biotic  factors  is  still 

lacking. In the previous chapters, we tested the hypothesis of a pathogenic origin and 

we demonstrated that indeed, R. solani causes black scurf or sclerotia attachment to 

the  tubers  but  none  of  the  283  other  soil-borne  microorganisms  associated  to  the 

 

175

Chapter 6 – Effect of environmental conditions in the occurrence of blemishes 

 
 
various  blemishes  found  on  potato  tubers  were  responsible  for  the  appearance  of 

those blemishes (Fiers et al., 2010). 

The second hypothesis about non biotic factors will be addressed in this part through 

a specific focus on the environmental conditions or cultural practices that can cause 

the  occurrence  of potato blemishes. Testing  individually  every  factor  of  climate,  soil 

characteristics  and  crop  management  plan  would  have  been  very  tedious  and  not 

really representative of the field conditions. Thus, in order to be as close as possible 

to the real crop conditions, we decided to realize a survey with farmers to determine 

favourable and unfavourable environmental parameters to the development of tuber 

blemishes.  Moreover,  we  performed  statistical  analyses  to  depict  any  putative 

relationship  between  the  potato  cultivar  and  the  occurrence  of  potato  blemishes. 

Indeed,  it  has  been  shown  that  the  same  biotic  or/and  abiotic  factor  can  induce 

blemishes  of  various aspects and  that  potato  cultivars  differ  in  their  susceptibility  to 

the blemishes (Lutomirska, 2007; Wanner and Haynes, 2009).  

 

 

 

Material and methods 

The survey was conducted in the main French potato production basins in the 

North  and  the  West  of  France  with  45  potato  producers  chosen  according  to  the 

amount of blemished tubers they harvested in 2007. A semi structured questionnaire 

was send to the farmers. They were asked to give data on their cultural practices and 

the soil characteristics of the field. The survey takes into account soil characteristics 

such as soil depth, pH value, cation exchange capacity (CEC) value, organic matter 

rate,  texture,  and  structure  (Figure  6.1).  Soil  structure  was  considered  as  “good” 

when  the  soil  was  aerated, fragmented  with  a  good filtering  coefficient.  A  “bad”  soil 

structure  was  characterized  by  a  compact  and  asphyxiated  soil.  Cultural  practices 

were evaluated by comparing delays between the dates of planting and dehaulming 

and  between  the  date  of  dehaulming  and  harvesting,  rotation  length,  preceding 

crops, irrigation and drainage during the potato crop. Meteorological data were also 

collected. The amounts of water received by the crop, i.e. precipitations + irrigation, 

and the average temperature during all the growing season were taken into account. 

 176

Chapter 6 – Effect of environmental conditions in the occurrence of blemishes 

 
 
For each parameter, answers were distributed in 2 to 4 categories that were related 
to the occurrence of blemishes with a Chi square (Khi2) test (α = 0.05).  

In  addition,  blemished  potato  tubers  were  collected  in  2006  and  2007  in  the  same 

French  areas  and  in  Switzerland,  Italy  (Sicilia),  and  Morocco.  All  the  surveyed 

producers  provided  samples  collected  in  2007.  Each  sample  was  collected  from  a 

single  field.  In  2006  and  2007,  a  collection  of  92  and  122  samples  of  tubers 

presenting  blemishes  from  29  and  45  different  cultivars  respectively  was  set  up.  A 

picture  of  each  tuber  was  taken;  blemishes  were  classified  in  4  classes  (sclerotia, 

atypical corky blemishes, potato scabs and enlarged lenticels) and they were scored 

according to the French notation scale edited by the French official service of control 

and  certification  (SOC)  (GNIS  and  SOC,  2005).  For  each  year,  a  test  of  conformity 

with the binomial law was performed (α = 0.05) in order to test the conformity of the 

occurrence  of  the  blemishes  with  the  theoretical  probability.  A  significant  high 

frequency  of  occurrence  of  a  given  blemish  on  a  cultivar  would  reveal  a  specific 

sensibility of the cultivar to that blemish. The dependence between the lines and the 

columns  of  the  contingency  tables  was  tested  with  a  Chi  square  test.  The 

relationships  between  the  potato  cultivars  and  the  blemishes  were  represented  by 

factorial  correspondence  analysis  (FCA).  The  statistical  tests  were  performed  with 

the XLStat Pro 7.5 software (Addinsoft, version 7.5).

Results 

Among the collected tubers, 38 % presented atypical corky blemishes in 2006 

and 40 % in 2007, 34 % of the tubers had sclerotia both in 2006 and 2007, 15 % had 

potato  scabs  symptoms  in  2006  and  10  %  in  2007,  whereas  13  %  presented 

enlarged lenticels in 2006 and 16 % in 2007. 

More than 53 % of the farmers answered the survey. The average rate of answers to 

every question was 67.7 %. Despite, the good answering rate of the survey, the total 

number  of  fulfilled  questionnaires  was  too  weak  to  reach  a  pertinent  statistical 

signification. Nevertheless, interesting tendencies could be shown. 

Average  surveyed  fields  had  a  soil  depth  between  60  and  90  cm,  a  pH  value 

between 6 and 7, the CEC value was under 15 meq / 100 g of soil and the organic 

matter  rate  was  between  2  and  4  %.  Soils  were  generally  loamy,  with  a  good 

structure.  Delay  between  planting  and  dehaulming  was  commonly  longer  than  100 

days and delay between dehaulming and harvesting was shorter than 40 days. There 

were as many rotations longer than 5 years than rotations shorter than 5 years and 

cereals were the most frequent crops included in the rotation. In general, no intercrop 

was used and there were neither drainage nor irrigation (Figure 6.1). 

Results  showed  significant  effects  of  pH  and  delay  between  dehaulming  and 

harvesting  (α  =  0.05).  A  pH  value  between  6  and  7  increased  the  occurrence  of 

atypical corky blemishes and a period longer than 40 days between dehaulming and 

harvesting favoured the development of potato scabs symptoms (Figure 6.1). Results 

nearby  the  significant  threshold  indicated  that  a  rotation  length  between  3  and  5 

years  increased  the  risk  of  sclerotia  occurrence  whereas  a  rotation  longer  than  5 

years decreased the risk. About 70 % of the farmers grew cereals before potatoes in 

the  rotation  without  any  positive  or  negative  effect  on  the  occurrence  of  the 

blemishes.  Climatic  conditions,  especially  pluviometry  below  350  mm  had  also  an 

impact on blemishes by enhancing the occurrence of sclerotia all along the growing 

Concerning  the  cultivars-blemishes  relationships,  data  of  2006  and  2007  were  not 

treated  together,  because  the  two  sampling  years  have  had  very  different  climatic 

conditions in France. In 2006, the temperatures were exceptionally high (+ 1 or + 2°C 

season.

higher  than  seasonal  averages)  and  the  pluviometry  was  normal.  In  2007,  the 

cropping season was fresh and very humid. The majority of the sample comes from 

the North West of France where the precipitations in 2007 were 2 to 3 times higher 

than  the  seasonal  average  (Météo  France).  The  Chi-square  test  showed  that  the 

lines  and  the  columns  were  significantly  independent  (α  =  0.05)  for  the  two  years. 

The  FCA  represented  88.59  %  of  the  total  variability  in  2006  (F1:  50.10  %  and  F2: 

38.49  %,  Figure  6.2)  and  87.14  %  of  the  variability  in  2007  (F1:  49.97  %  and  F2: 

37.17 %, Figure 6.3).  

In 2006, the FCA showed that the cultivars Adriana, Chérie and Désirée were distinct 

from  the  other  cultivars.  Moreover,  the  cultivar  Chérie  was  significantly  associated 

with potato scabs (coefficient = 0.001). The tests of conformity with the binomial law 

indicated  that  Amandine  and  Anoe  were  displaying  significantly  more  enlarged 

lenticels  than  the  other  cultivars,  with  coefficient  values  of  0.020  and  0.031 

respectively (α = 0.05). The FCA showed also that cultivars Spunta was significantly 

more  susceptible  to  atypical  corky  blemishes  than  the  other  cultivars  with  a 

coefficient  of  0.039.  Other  cultivars  seem  not  to  be  particularly  susceptible  to  a 

specific blemish (Figure 6.2).

In 2007, the FCA showed again the close relationship between the cultivar Amandine 

and  enlarged  lenticels  as  confirmed  by  the  test  of  conformity  with  the  binomial  law 
which had a coefficient value of 6.883 x 10-5 (α = 0.05). As in 2006, cultivar Spunta 

was  associated  with  atypical  corky  blemishes,  as  showed  by  the  almost  significant 

value  of  the  conformity  test  (0.065).  Potato  scabs  distinguished  also  from  the  other 

blemishes on the FCA. They seemed to affect more specially the cultivars Urgenta, 

Emeraude  and  Viola.  However,  the  number  of  analysed  tubers  is  too  weak  so  that 

the  test  of  conformity  is  significant.  Nevertheless,  the  test  showed  that  the  cultivars 

Bintje and Désirée are significantly affected by potato scabs with coefficient values of 
5.801  x  10-4  and  0.048  respectively.  Otherwise,  no  particular  relationship  appears 

between the others cultivars and blemishes in 2007 (Figure 6.3). 

Some genetically related cultivars appeared to be susceptible to the same blemishes. 

Nicola, Juliette, Charlotte and Amandine, which have a common genetic background 

presented  similar  susceptibility  to  atypical  corky  blemishes  and  sclerotia  on  the  2 

AFC. In particular, Amandine issues from a crossing between Charlotte and another 

cultivar; this relationship between Amandine and Charlotte was emphasized through 

the FCA which revealed for the two consecutive years the common susceptibility of 

those  two  cultivars  to  enlarged  lenticels  and  sclerotia.  Likewise  Désirée,  Rosanna, 

Kennebec  and  Atlas  which  have  also  genetic 

links  presented  a  particular 

susceptibility to potato scabs in 2006.

Chapter 6– Effect of environmental conditions in the occurrence of blemishes 

  

 

 

 
Discussion 

In Brittany, our major sampling place, the soils are a bit acidic with an average 

of  6.3  compared  with  the  range  of  values  (from  5  to  >  8)  displayed  by  agricultural 

soils in France (Arrouays et al., 2010). Almost 30 % of the surveyed fields belonged 

to  the  category  of  pH  between  6  and  7,  and  those  pH  values  seemed  to  be 

favourable  to  the  occurrence  of  atypical  corky  blemishes.  Nevertheless,  pH  is  a 

complex factor that affects several other parameters. It determines the availability of 

soil  nutrients  and  elements  contents  that  can  impact  the  potato  sanitary  status 

(Stengel et al., 2009). Indeed a deficiency or an excess of one of the macronutrients 

(nitrogen,  phosphorus,  potassium)  or  micronutrients  (iron,  manganese,  aluminium, 

etc.) is a source of stress for the plant and it can result into blemish occurrence on 

tubers  (Zorn,  1995;  Sarkar  et  al.,  2004).  The  element  rates  of  each  surveyed  soils 

should  be  taken  into  account  to  determine  the  real  role  played  by  pH  in  the 

appearance of blemishes. 

On  the  other  hand,  we  showed  that  a  period  of  time  between  dehaulming  and 

harvesting longer than 40 days was harmful for potato as the severity of potato scabs 

developing  on  tubers  increased.  This  confirms  the  results  obtained  previously 

indicating  that  the  quality  of  ware  potatoes  can  be  controlled  by  adjusting  planting 

and harvesting dates (Sikka and Singh, 1976). Minimum disease severity is generally 

recorded when tubers are directly harvested along with foliage. However, with delay 

in date of haulm cut, there is gradual and significant increase in tuber yield. As long 

as tubers are attached to the green plants, the photosynthates keep on accumulating 

in  tubers,  i.e.  the  biological  sink.  Once  the  green  top  is  removed  the  tubers  in  soil 

attached  to  stolons  and  roots,  are  likely  to  be  more  liable  to  various  infections 

including  that  of  Streptomyces  spp.  and  R.  solani  (Sangeeta  and  Pundhir,  2009). 

Time interval between dehaulming and harvesting has to be long enough to allow for 

the convenient growth of the tubers, but also short enough to avoid the formation of 

potato  scab.  The  dehaulming  –  harvesting  delay  has  to  be  calculated  according  to 

the  pressure  exerted  by  Streptomyces  spp.  inoculum  on  the  crop.  Concerning  the 

rotation length, it is known since a long time that long rotations allow the decrease or 

the  eradication  of  pathogen  inoculums  (Peters  et  al.,  2003).    The  longer  the  time 

between two potato crops, the less the concentration of R. solani inoculum, the less 

 

185

Chapter 6– Effect of environmental conditions in the occurrence of blemishes 

 

  
severe  black  scurf  will  be.  Rotation  length  is  an  important  parameter  to  take  into 

account as well as the rotation composition. Cereals in the rotation did not increase 

nor  decrease  the  appearance  of  the  blemishes.  Consequently  this  crop  can  be 

integrated into the rotation without risk. 

Our  results  did  not  show  any  effects  of  high  soil  temperature,  heterogeneous 

distribution of the organic matter in soil and excessive moisture on the occurrence of 

blemishes,  as  it  has  been  previously  suggested  (Stevenson  et  al.,  2001;  Sexton, 

2003; Selman et al., 2008). However, we showed that excessive moisture decreased 

the  occurrence  of  sclerotia.  In  literature,  papers  on  this  subject  are  rather 

contradictory.  Some  authors  claimed  that  black  scurf  is  favoured  by  high  soil 

moisture  (Lakra,  1995;  El  Bakali  and  Martin,  2006),  others  showed  that  irrigation 

decreased black scurf (Hide et al., 1994), or that there was no influence of rainfall on 

sclerotia  occurrence  (Lutomirska, 2007).  Nevertheless,  rainfall  and  irrigation  are  not 

systematically  correlated  with  high  soil  moisture  content.  Indeed,  well  drained  soils 

avoid  overcoming  the water  holding  capacity  of  the fields even  after  strong  rains  or 

too important irrigation. 

Since,  the  number  of  answered  questionnaires  was  low,  this  study  can  not  provide 

irrefutable 

information  or  concrete  advises  on 

favourable  or  unfavourable 

environmental  traits  and  cultural  practices  for  the  management  of  healthy  potato 

crop. Nevertheless, our results are good indicators to highlight the points that need to 

be  watched  in  order  to  avoid  blemish  occurrence.  Some  factors  are  favourable  to 

some blemishes and unfavourable to others. Therefore, a large scale survey should 

be undergone among the producers with some more specific and precise questions 

issuing  from  the  present  survey  such  as  soil  pH,  soil  texture,  organic  matter  (soil 

content  and  dispersion  in  the  soil),  delay  around  haulm  destruction,  rotation  length 

and  previous  crops,  moisture  (irrigation,  pluviometry  and  drainage)  and  soil 

The choice of the potato cultivar is a major cultural practice that allows adapting the 

crop to the market expectations, to the environmental conditions and to the sanitary 

risks.  This  work  aimed  at  established  relationships  if  any  between  potato  cultivars 

and  superficial  blemishes.  We  could  have  studied  the  relationships  between  the 

cultivars and the geographical origins of the samples or between the blemishes and 

temperatures.  

 

 186

Chapter 6– Effect of environmental conditions in the occurrence of blemishes 

 

  
the  geographical  origins,  but  it  would  have  been  biased  since  some  cultivars  are 

more  frequently  cropped  in  some  areas  because  of  the  climate  and  the  way  the 

potatoes will be used (seeds, ware, or processing). 

Despite the different climatic conditions in the two years, the 2 AFC showed that the 

susceptibility of the cultivars to the blemishes was rather constant in 2006 and 2007. 

This confirms previous results claiming that the relative susceptibility of a cultivar to a 

given  blemish  remains  approximately  the  same  whatever  the  environmental 

conditions.  For  example,  a  susceptible  cultivar  will  always  have  more  severe 

blemishes  or  symptoms  than  a  resistant  cultivar  whatever  the  climatic  conditions 

(INRA and Agrocampus, 2006; 2007; 2008). 

Some  cultivars  were  represented  by  only  one  sample  whereas  other  cultivars  were 

represented by at most 28 samples. Indeed, some cultivars are more frequently used 

than others. The results concerning cultivars represented by one or two samples can 

not be considered as representative of the cultivar's behaviour. 

Our  results  also  showed  that  the  cultivars  with  a  common  genetic  background  are 

liable  to  the  same blemishes,  what  is  in  agreement  with  previous studies  (Bozec  et 

al., 2005).  

New  potato  cultivar  assessment  takes  into  account  several  crop  and  tuber 

characteristics,  especially  disease  resistance  of 

the  cultivars.  However 

the 

aggressiveness  of  each  pathogen  is  expressed  according  to  the  response  of  the 

cultivar and the environmental conditions. Resistance assessments frequently reveal 

that  common  scab  is  the  only  tested  disease  among  the  superficial  blemishes 

affecting  the  potato  tuber.  Indeed,  Solanum  tuberosum  –  Streptomyces  spp. 

relationship is one of the few potato parasitic complexes that gather available data at 

the  cultivar  level,  although  the  behaviour  of  the  potato  phenotypes  against 

Streptomyces  spp.  still  remains  environment-dependant  (Pasco  et  al.,  2005; 

Anonymous,  2009).  The  description  and  the  awareness  about  atypical  superficial 

blemishes vary according to countries and remain frequently unclear. That is one of 

the  reasons  why  official  assessments  for  registration  of  new  potato  cultivars  do  not 

integrate cultivar behaviour to atypical blemishes into the evaluation criteria yet, even 

if some official assessments were recently validated in France about pitted vs. netted 

scab  (Pasco  et  al.,  2005)  and  in  Switzerland,  about  tuber  deformations  due  to  R. 

solani (Reust and Torche, 2008). 

 

187

Chapter 6– Effect of environmental conditions in the occurrence of blemishes 

 

  
In  the  previous  chapters,  we  concluded  that no  causality  links  could  be  established 

between  the  microorganisms  associated  to  blemishes  and  the  occurrence  of  the 

blemishes.  In  this  chapter,  we  are  inclined  to  think  that  some  non  biotic  factors 

including  climate  and  agricultural  practices  are  involved  in  the  appearance  of  the 

blemishes  and  also  that  susceptible  cultivars  could  exacerbate  this  appearance. 

Therefore, it should be possible in the future to overcome the problem by innovative 

management  of  the  production  although  it  is  still  very  difficult  to  adopt  a  course  of 

action avoiding all the problems.

In  the  global  current  context  of  massive  demographic  increase,  potatoes  are 

desirable  to  feed  the  global  populations  and  to  contribute  to  their  economical  and 

social  development.  Obviously,  the  issues  and  constrains  of  potato  production  are 

not the same according to the country. Developing countries aim at supplying enough 

staple  potato  production  to  meet  increasing  food  demands,  whereas  developed 

countries  have  to  provide  good  quality  products  matching  with  the  consumers' 

expectations.  Among  other  factors,  the  economical  development  of  fresh  potato 

producers in developed countries depends on the visual quality of the tubers. Indeed, 

the  losses  due  to  the  downgrading  or  rejecting  of  blemished  tubers  hamper  the 

proper  evolution  of  the  fresh  potato  industry.  Consumers  are  more  and  more 

demanding concerning food quality. The perception of fresh fruits and vegetables has 

changed  since  populations  became  more  urban  and  are  less  familiar  with  the 

production systems. Consumers who were more familiar with the geographical origin 

of  fruit  and  vegetable  production  mentioned  non-sensory  attributes  –  mode  of 

production,  variety  -  more  often  than  those  with  less  contact,  who,  in  contrary 

mentioned  sensory  attributes  –  aspect,  odour,  touch  -  (Peneau,  2005).  Concerning 

fresh  potatoes,  blemished  tubers  are  not  well  perceived  by  the  consumers,  even  if 

they do not affect the nutritional quality of the product. In the long term, efforts should 

be made to make the consumers aware of the quality of fresh potatoes despite some 

visual  blemishes,  but  at  the  present  time  solutions  to  avoid  the  occurrence  of 

blemishes are needed. The determination of their causes is a crucial point that has to 

be  clarified  in  order  to  optimize  its  control.  A  global  review  of  the  knowledge  about 

soil-borne potato diseases was proposed in chapter 1 on this thesis. Data about the 

conditions  of  appearance  and  development of  diseases  are essential  to understand 

the  mechanisms  underlying  host  -  pathogen  interactions  and  to  set  up  efficient 

methods  to  control  diseases.  The  first  chapter  of  this  work  can  be  considered  as  a 

decision  support  system  to  avoid  damages  on  potato  crop  since  it  resumes  all  the 

favourable  and  unfavourable  conditions  affecting 

the  occurrence  and 

the 

development of the soil-borne diseases of potato. Nevertheless, very little information 

 

191

General discussion 

were  collected  in  the  literature  on  the  blemishes  despite  the  evident  need  of 

knowledge  on  this  subject.  Consequently,  the  demand  of  extension  people  and 

farmers for further researches aiming at solving this problem was foreseeable.  

 

Ce  qui  se  conçoit  bien  s'énonce  clairement  et  les  mots  pour  le  dire  arrivent 

aisement - What is well conceived is expressed clearly, and the words to say it come 

easily-  wrote  Nicolas  Boileau-Despréaux,  a  famous  French  poet  and  writer  in  1674 

(Boileau-Despréaux 1674). This sentence sums up the first objective of this work that 

was  to  propose  clear  and  consensual  terminology  and  classification  of  the  different 

blemishes that can be observed on tuber surface (chapter 2). Some atypical potato 

blemishes,  such  as  polygonal  lesions,  were  observed  since  a  long  time  and  were 

named "elephant hide", especially in USA. The first paper we found in the literature 

about  this  issue  dates  from  1966  (Peters,  1966).  Other  authors  approached  briefly 

the  subject  in  the  70's  (Hart,  1971).  They  mentioned  some  observations  and 

suggested  few  probable  causes  but  no  actual  study  was  carried  out.  In  the  2000's, 

few  papers  dealing  with  blemishes  were  recorded.  Two  of  them  studied  more  in 

depth  the  implication  of  Rhizoctonia  solani  in  the  occurrence  of  the  atypical 

blemishes (Campion et al., 2003; Woodhall et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the overview 

of  those  rare  previous  studies  showed  the  heterogeneity  and  confusion  in  the 

different names used for the blemishes. Seeing the importance of the problem for the 

potato  community,  it  was  necessary  to  examine  the  matter  in  more  detail,  with 

experts from the seed, ware and processed potato sector, researchers and breeders, 

and the first thing to do was to harmonise the nomenclature and the classification of 

the  blemishes  in  order  to  avoid  misunderstandings  and  favour  collaborative

General discussion 

Those  variations  allowed  collecting  very  diverse  types  of  blemishes  during  the  two 

years. 

Two  causes  were  possible  to  explain  the  appearance  of  the  blemishes.  Either  they 

were due to one or several pathogens or they resulted from a reaction of the plant to 

unfavourable environmental conditions (Agrios, 2005). Our first goal was to make an 

exhaustive  isolation  and  identification of  the  microorganisms  living  at  the  surface  of 

the  tubers  (chapter  3).  However,  the  scope  of  the  study  constrained  us  to  target 

some  microorganisms.  A  large  diversity  of  fungi  was  identified  but  the  method  we 

used  allowed  us  isolating  only  cultivable  fungi.  Concerning  bacteria,  we  targeted 

Streptomyces,  known  to  be  implicated  in  several  potato  diseases  especially  netted 

scab that causes blemishes, very similar to the atypical blemishes. The pathogenicity 

of  the  Streptomyces  isolates  and  the  fungi  the  most  frequently  isolated  from  the 

surface  of  the  blemished  tubers  was  tested  in  bioassays  with  infested  soil.  This 

classical technique aimed at favouring the development of a specific microorganism 

in  the  soil  and  at  fulfilling  the  Koch's  postulates.  Koch's  postulates  fulfilment  is  the 

only known method to prove rigorously the pathogenicity of a microorganism (Rapilly, 

2001). The fulfilment of the four postulates was not easy, especially as the bioassays 

were conducted in a non sterile environment. Aerial microorganisms could develop in 

the soil and establish interactions with the tested microorganism or the tuber. Some 

microbial  interactions  were  tested  by  inoculating  tubers  with  combinations  of  two 

microorganisms.  In  all  those  tests,  blemishes  were  produced  showing  that  we 

succeeded in creating favourable conditions to blemish formation, but apart from R. 

solani,  there  was  no  relationship  between  an  inoculated  microorganism  and  the 

occurrence  of  the  blemishes.  We  enlarged  the  domain  of  investigations  from  the 

surface  of  the  tuber  to  the  surrounding  geocaulosphere  and  from  the  artificial 

conditions  of the  greenhouse  to  the  natural conditions  of a field  in  which  superficial 

blemishes were previously regularly observed (chapter 4). This approach based on 

the  analysis  of  the  microbial  structure  in  the  soil  close  to  the  altered  and  the  non 

altered  potato  was  used  to  overcome  the  practical  limitation  of  the  approach  based 

on isolation. Such an approach was already successfully used to identify the fungal 

populations  of  Trichoderma  spp.  involved  in  the  dynamics  of  infectious  patches 

caused  by  R.  solani  in  sugar  beet  crop  (Anees  et  al.,  2010a).  Unfortunately,  no 

noticeable  peak  (TRF)  which  could  have  indicated  the  relative  abundance  of  a 

microbial  group  to  identify  in  the  geocaulosphere  of  blemished  tubers  compared  to 

 

193

General discussion 

the one of healthy tubers was recorded, apart, once again, the TRF corresponding to 

the  R.  solani  group.  Although  modifications  of  the  structures  of  the  fungal  and 

bacterial  communities  were  observed  at  the  different  sampling  dates  and  in  the 

vicinity  of  blemished  tubers,  we  could  not  conclude  that  these  modifications  were 

responsible for the appearance of the blemishes or if, at the contrary, the blemished 

potato  had  specific  exudates  that  could  change  the  population  ratios  among  the 

microbial communities. Anyway, this non-a priori approach gave the same results as 

the Pasteurian one based on the fulfilment of Koch postulates. No causality between 

the  presence  of  microorganisms  and  the  appearance  of  atypical  blemishes  was 

found  apart  in  the  case  of  R.  solani.  We  concluded  that  R.  solani  was  actually 

responsible for sclerotia but the other blemishes were not of pathogenic origin. 

 

We  therefore  focused  on  this  pathogen  to  know  more  about  its  diversity, 

although  it  is  not  really  involved  in  atypical  blemishes  but  it  is  in  quite  typical  and 

already described blemishes called sclerotia. R. solani is a very  common soil-borne 

pathogen  with  a  large  diversity  of  host  plants  and  causing  various  diseases  under 

diverse environmental conditions. Julius Kühn observed this fungus for the first time 

on  potato  in  1858.  R.  solani  can  cause  seed  decay,  damping  off,  root  rot  or  stem 

canker  on  bean,  cotton,  cabbage,  sugar  beet,  alfalfa,  tomato,  potato  etc  (Parmeter, 

1970). In fact, there is a relative host specificity of the different anastomosis groups 

(AG) of R. solani. On potato, we isolated especially AG 3, AG 2-1 and AG 5. AG 3 

and more precisely the subgroup associated with potato, AG 3 PT is known to cause 

black scurf and stem canker on potato tubers (Kuninaga et al., 2000). AG 2-1 and AG 

5 were isolated at lesser extent than AG 3 but they are supposed to be implicated in 

the  appearance  of  atypical  blemishes.  Nevertheless,  Koch's  postulates  were  not 

fulfilled for these two AGs neither in chapter 3 nor in other studies (Campion et al., 

2003;  Woodhall  et  al.,  2008).  It  is  very  difficult  to  eradicate  R.  solani  once  the 

pathogen  is  in  the field.   The fungus  may  cause  up  to  30  % of  losses  in the  potato 

production  (Banville,  1989).  Moreover,  chemical  treatments  against  plant  diseases 

are more and more limited because of the current regulations for the protection of the 

environment all over the world. Many chemicals previously used are now forbidden. 

New  control  techniques  are  studied;  they  include unfavourable  cultural  practices for 

the  pathogen  (chapter  6),  sustainable  chemical  treatments  and  biological  control 

(Wilson et al., 2008). Chapter 6 of this thesis mentioned that abundant irrigation and 

 194

General discussion 

rotation  longer  than  5  years  could  decrease  the  soil  inoculum  of  R.  solani.  On  the 

other  hand,  microbial  cocktails,  growth  hormones  and  several  other  stimulators  of 

plant  defence  response  are  tested  (Mahmoud,  2007).  Those  new  control  methods 

are currently tested by Végénov-Bretagne Biotechnologie Végétale (BBV) to assess 

their  efficacy  against  potato  blemishes.  The  application  of  such  control  methods 

implies  a  deep  knowledge  of  the  epidemiology  and  the  ecology  of  the  pathogen. 

Even  if  R.  solani  has  been  studied  for  more  than  150  years,  uncertainties  remain 

concerning  its  ecology,  especially  classification  and  taxonomy.  R.  solani  is  a 

multinucleate fungus. This  can  introduce many  variations  in  its  genome.  In  chapter 

5, the study of the phylogenetic relationships between the French strains of R. solani 

compared  with  strains  from  other  countries  showed  that  there  was  no  geographical 

structure  of  the  R.  solani  population  and  no  relationship  between  the  host  cultivars 

and the isolates of R. solani. This suggests that frequent genetic events and genetic 

mixing  take  place  at  a  large  scale  all  over  the  world,  without  any  structure  of  the 

population could have been drawn, probably because of the limited dissemination of 

R. solani. The spread of genomes probably occurs because of the global exchange 

market  of  seed  tubers  inducing  numerous  international  transportations  of  potatoes 

potentially contaminated by mycelium or sclerotia of R. solani (Justesen et al., 2003). 

 

The  second  possible  cause  of  the  blemishes  was  related  to  stressful 

environmental conditions. Potato tubers are subterranean stems. They develop in a 

complex  environment  which  is  the  soil  and  which  harbours  both  biotic  and  abiotic 

components.  The  survey  we  did  was  quite  limited  and  we  discussed,  in  chapter  6, 

that  this  was  a  restraint  preventing  us  from  general  and  definitive  conclusion. 

Anyway,  we  saw  that  the  physico-chemical  traits  of  the  soil  such  as  pH  and  water 

availability interfere with the plant health status and impact the occurrence of atypical 

corky  blemishes  and  sclerotia.  This  leads  us  to  the  conclusion  that  this  hypothesis 

was more likely to bring us with the identification of the causes of the appearance of 

blemishes than the microbial one, although they are not exclusive mutually. However 

it  is  clear  and  we  mentioned  it,  that  a  large  scale  survey  should  be  conducted  to 

provide us with more precise information about the list and the relative importance of 

the  abiotic  factors  which  seemed  to  be  involved  in  the  appearance  of  blemishes. 

Large  scale  means  both  geographic  areas,  climatic  conditions  and  agricultural 

practices but also a large number of parameters surrounding the plant itself including 

 

195

General discussion 

aerial part, geocaulosphere and rhizosphere of the potato. Biotic factors should also 

be included as parameters to measure as they interact with abiotic factors and thus 

might  have  an  indirect  role  on  the  occurrence  or  development  of  the  atypical 

blemishes. The rhizosphere is a favourable area for microbial development. Carbon, 

nitrogen,  phosphorus,  potassium  and  other  micronutriments  are  released  by  the 

plants in the rhizosphere and they are a source of energy for the microorganisms. In 

return,  microorganisms  contribute  to  the  plant  nutrition  by  altering  minerals  and 

through  symbiotic  associations  such  as  mycorhization  or  formation  of  nodosities 

(Stengel et al., 2009). Exudates released by the plants modify the microenvironment 

of  the  rhizosphere.  The  soil  pH  and  the  chemical  balances  change  increasing  the 

availability of nutrients for the plant. Moreover, those major modifications change the 

structure of the microbial communities in the rhizosphere. As evocated in chapter 4, 

the  structures  of  the  microbial  communities  of  the  potato  geocaulosphere  evolve  in 

time  and  according  to  the  phenology  of  the  plant.  Similar  mechanisms  could  take 

place  in  rhizosphere  and  geocaulosphere.  Indeed,  we  showed  that  the  microbial 

communities  and  especially  the  bacterial  communities  were  different  in  the 

geocaulosphere  of  healthy  plants  according  the  period  of  time,  but  they  evolve 

toward  an  identical  structure  in  the  geocaulosphere  of  blemished  tubers.  This 

showed  that  there  are  many  mutual  interactions  between  plants  and  soil-borne 

microorganisms in which the human can interfere in order to improve the agronomic 

systems.  

We showed also in our study that the cultivar has to be chosen according the future 

use of the progeny tubers and also according to the sanitary risks incurred in a given 

field:  amount  of  pathogenic  inoculum,  climatic  conditions,  soil  characteristics,  etc. 

Choice of unadapted cultivar will increase the sanitary risks. If the weather conditions 

are  also  unfavourable,  it  could  be  hard  to  control  the  risk  even  with  good  cultural 

practices and adapted control methods. Most of European potato cultivars belong to 

Solanum  tuberosum  species  but  about  10  other  Solanum  species  are  cultivated  in 

South America and 200 wild species are registered (FAO, 2008). Disease and insect 

resistance  of  natural  populations,  or  traditional  cultivars  developed  by  Andean 

farmers, is an important legacy. Genetic selection of potatoes for disease resistance 

did probably not begin before the end of the late blight epidemic in Ireland between 

1845 and 1849. Since then, continuous progresses are made to breed new cultivars 

resistant  to  the  new  diseases  and  with  good  intrinsic  qualities.  Therefore,  the 

 196

General discussion 

susceptibility of the potato plant, i.e. the cultivar, has to be included in the set of biotic 

and abiotic data to be considered to evaluate the risk of blemish appearance. Some 

efforts  were  already  done  to  propose  models  aiming  at  evaluating  the  risk  of 

production  losses  (Savary  et  al.,  2006).  Similar  efforts  should  be  done  using 

statistical  analysis  to  identify  indicators  and  bioindicators  of  the  beneficial  or 

deleterious  environment  of  the  potato  during  crop  production  but  more  precisely 

during  the  period  during  which  blemishes  appear  (Janvier  et  al.,  2007).  Such 

approach  should  stimulate  the  build  up  of  decision  support  systems  to  prevent 

blemishes. 

 

This  thesis  tackled  topical  issues  at  several  scales.  The  project  was  initially 

consecutive  to  repeated  requests  of  technical  staff  in  the  fresh-washed  potato 

production  to  limit  the  annual  non  negligible  amount  of  fresh  potatoes  that  were 

down-graded  due  to  poor  visual  quality.  Because  the  tuber  is  also  the  plant  for 

planting,  ie  the  seed,  then  a  strong  demand  for  high  visual  quality  seeds  has 

challenged  seed  potato  growers  to  produce  very  high  quality  seeds;  with  the  hope 

that  this  measure  would  solve  the  tuber  blemish  issue  in  the  following  growing 

season. Seed potato producers in Brittany, together with fresh potato growers have 

then  launched this  project  in  order  to find out  solutions  while  respecting  the  current 

environmental  regulations.  This  problem  concerns  also  the  global  agriculture  which 

needs  to  produce  abundant  and  qualitative  food  products  and  has  to  protect  the 

planet  at  the  same  time.  Those  preoccupations  meet  the  first  and  the  seventh 

millennium development goals of the United Nations Organisation: End poverty and 

hunger  and  ensure  environmental  sustainability  (ONU,  2000).  Measures  introduced 

to  reach  those  goals  depend  largely  on  our  capacity  to  manage  an  alternative 

agriculture with beneficial socioeconomic and environmental impacts. This is the aim 

of  agroecology.  Agroecology  provides  the  scientific  basis  to  address  the  production 

by  a  biodiverse  agroecosystem  able  to  sponsor  its  own  functioning  (Altieri,  2002). 

Agroecology  initially  dealt  primarily  with  crop  production  and  protection  aspects,  in 

recent  decades  new  dimensions  such  as  environmental,  social,  economic,  ethical 

and  development  issues  are  becoming  relevant  (Wezel  et  al.,  2009).  Thus,  by 

studying  the  causes  of  the  occurrence  of  potato  tuber  blemishes  at  a  microscopic 

scale,  this  project  dealt  with  quite  larger  scales  that  aim  at  developing  global 

 

197

agriculture,  improving  the  socio-economical  conditions  for  farmers  and  finding 

sustainable techniques for crop management. 

General discussion 

Future prospects 

Based  on  the  conclusions  we  drawn  back  from  our  study,  and  also,  as  an 

obvious corollary, on the analysis of the literature we did, I would suggest first a short 

term practical perspective about a common terminology we should have about potato 

blemishes. 

But  I  think  also  that  the  approaches  we  used,  although  they  provided  a  lot  of 

information and partial responses to the original question, were not totally satisfying 

to the growers as we did not give a clear and definitive answer towards the causality 

of  blemishes,  we  just  provided  with  promising  tracks.  That  is  why  I  would  propose 

some  middle  term  perspectives  about  the  i)  plant-pathogen  interactions  and  plant 

defence reactions, ii) the definition of indicators of the soil health to built up decision 

support  systems  for  the  growers  and    iii)  an  integrated  pest  management  study 

directly related to the previous proposed perspectives.  

Practical perspectives 

New  nomenclature  and  classification  were  suggested  in  order  to  harmonize 

further  works  on  potato  blemishes.  It  has  been  written  in  English  for  a  scientific 

journal  which  will  be  available  for  a  limited  number  of  potato  scientists  and 

researchers.  The  value  of  such  nomenclature  is  to  be  spread  at  all  levels  in  the 

potato industry and among extension staff. Translations in several languages of this 

nomenclature  and  publication  in  technical  reviews  could  allow  farmers,  technicians 

as  well  as  engineers  or  researchers  to  exchange  about  blemishes  with  the  same 

words  and  the  same  meanings.  This  nomenclature  could  be  used  in  certification 

shemes to allow the identification and the precise description of tuber blemishes that 

are still rarely taken into account in the criteria of certification of the tubers.

Research perspectives 

 

 

i) 

Plant-pathogen interactions and plant defence reactions 

In  addition  to  the  microbial  mechanisms  and  the  environmental  conditions  we 

evoked  during  this  study  and  that  may  lead  to  the  reduction  of  the  pathogenic 

attacks,  plants  interact  with  their  environment,  especially  the  soil  environment 

through  the  rhizosphere  activity.  In  the  case  of  potato,  the  soil  surrounding  tuber  is 

called  geocaulosphere  and  can  be  compared  to  the  rhizosphere.  The  impact  of  the 

geocaulosphere  on  the  soil  charcteristics  and  the  microbial  communities  is  not  well 

known.  We  suggest  that  plant  rhizosphere  and  potato  geocaulosphere  could  be 

compared according to the release of exudates and their impact on the surrounding 

microbial communities. Regarding the lack of knowledge about this question it would 

be  interesting  to  study  the  similarities  and  differences  between  rhizosphere  and 

geocaulosphere  in  order  to  better  understand  the  interaction  between  plants, 

especially  potato,  soil  and  microorganisms.  Plants  are  able  to  defend  themselves 

from  pathogenic  or  environmental  stresses  by  setting  up  several  different 

mechanisms.  The  first  defence  system  is  mechanical;  it  includes  physical  barriers 

avoiding  the  entrance  and  spread  of  the  pathogen  in  the  plant.  The  second 

mechanism  induces  biochemical  reactions  that  produce  substances  either  toxic  for 

the  pathogens  or  inhibiting  their  growth  and  that  modify  the  plant  physiology.  The 

physiological mechanisms of the blemish formation have never been studied but it is 

known that after an attack, plant cells produce suberin that forms a cork layer on the 

cell  walls  (Pollard  et  al.,  2008).  The  accumulation  of  suberin  on  the  upper  layers  of 

the tuber periderm could lead to the formation of superficial corky structures such as 

those observed on blemished tubers. Even in the same host, defence reactions are 

different  depending  on  the  age  of  the  plant,  the  cultivar  or  the  weather  conditions 

(Agrios,  2005).  The  physiological  mechanisms  of  the  plant  leading  to  blemish 

formation  are  not  well  understood.  They  could  be  related  to  a  hypersensitive 

response  of  the  plant  and  all  the  physiological  changes  it  induces.  Are  the  plant 

defence process the same in response to a pathogenic or an environmental stress? 

What  are  the  differences?  Are  some  beneficial  microorganisms  able  to  potentialize 

the  plant  defence  reactions?  What  are  the  genes  implicated?  What  are  the 

physiological  functioning  leading  to  the  formation  of  the  blemishes  themselves? 

 

199

General discussion 

Those  are  some  questions  that  need  to  be  answered  in  the  next  years  in  order  to 

understand  the  mechanisms  underlying  the  tuber  blemish  formation.  Concerning  R. 

solani,  few  studies  report  that  this  fungus  produces  phytotoxins  leading  to  plant 

infections  (Gvozdeva  et  al.,  2006;  Brooks,  2007)  but  plant  -  pathogen  interactions 

need to be clarified.

ii)  

Definition of indicators of the soil health to built up decision aid supports for 

Soil  health  and  soil  quality  are  closed  concepts  that  allow  soil  functions  to  be 

related  to  specific  purpose  i.e.  to  maintain  an  appropriate  productivity  and  good 

quality of the products while simultaneously reducing the effects on the environment 

and  contributing  to  human  health.  However,  the  former  takes  into  account  more 

clearly plant health and therefore the phytosanitary aspect of the soil than soil quality 

(Janvier et al., 2007). Soil health assessment includes the quantification of indicators 

of soil quality. Such indicators may be derived from specific soil parameters obtained 

from  different  disciplines  of  soil  science,  but  descriptive  indicators  which  are 

inherently  qualitative  can  also  be  used  in  assessing  soil  health  and  soil  quality 

(Schjonning et al., 2004). Soil quality indicators condense an enormous complexity in 

the soil and therefore could be used as management tools to positively influence soil 

health.  Nevertheless,  they  have  to  be  chosen  to  be  usefully  used  and  not  too 

complex  to  handle  by  policy  makers  or  land  managers  (Doran  and  Zeiss,  2000).  In 

our  study,  we  showed  the  potential  implication  of  soil  characteristics  and  cultural 

practices  in  the  occurrence  of  the  blemishes  thanks  to  the  statistical  analyses  of  a 

survey conducted with some farmers from the West of France. But we concluded that 

more indicators would be useful to identify the beneficial and deleterious components 

preventing from or leading to blemishes so that agricultural practices could promote 

the  beneficial  components.  Therefore,  we  propose  to  conduct  a  survey  at  a  larger 

scale than the one we previously used to collect a larger amount of both specific and 

descriptive parameters. Such a survey could be conducted among the population of 

French  producers  of  seed  potato  whose  number  is  estimated  around  915  people 

(FNPPPT  and  GNIS,  2007).  A  representative  sample  of  this  population  should  be 

determined to provide information on both geographic areas, climatic conditions and 

agricultural  practices  but  also  a  large  number  of  parameters  surrounding  the  plant 

 200

General discussion 

itself  including  aerial  part,  geocaulosphere  and  rhizosphere  of  the  potato.  It  should 

provide  with  detailed  information  about  the  list  and  the  relative  importance  of  the 

abiotic  factors  which  seemed  to  be  involved  in  the  appearance  of  blemishes.  Biotic 

factors  should  also  be  included  as  parameters  to  measure  as  they  interact  with 

abiotic factors and thus might have an indirect role on the occurrence or development 

of the atypical blemishes. Appropriate multivariate statistical analyses combined with 

mathematical  model  based  on  the  data  set  will  identify  the  most  appropriate 

indicators  to  be  handled  by  the  growers,  i.e.  a  decision  support  system  to  manage 

the soil health to prevent blemishes and to conduct healthy potato crops. 

iii) Integrated pest management to control soil-borne pathogens of potatoes 

The soil microflora is composed of very diverse species that can be pathogenic or 

non  pathogenic  for  the  plant.  The  severity  of  a  disease  is  regulated  by  the  non 

pathogenic flora. Their ways of action are either active or passive. The antagonistic 

microorganisms  reduce  actively  the  pathogenic  populations  by  parasitism  or  by 

antibiosis,  whereas  other  species  can  compete  passively  with  the  pathogens  and 

deprive  them  from  essential  nutrients  or  ecological  niche  (Alabouvette  et  al.,  1996; 

Stengel  et  al.,  2009).  New  environmental  friendly  control  methods  are  inspired  by 

those  natural  mechanisms.  They  consist  in  inoculating  antagonistic  populations  in 

diseased  fields  or  in  favouring  the  development  and  the  activity  of  the  beneficial 

populations  by  sustainable  cultural  practices.  The  occurrence  of  sclerotia  due  to  R. 

solani  could  be  controlled  by  field  inoculation  of  efficient  antagonists  such  as 

Trichoderma spp. (Wilson et al., 2008). Cultural practices showing a reduction of the 

occurrence  of  some  tuber  blemishes  in  chapter  6  could  also  be  a  part  of  the 

sustainable  management  systems  leading  to  the  production  of  unblemished 

potatoes.  Storage  conditions  were  briefly  evocated  in  this  work.  Indeed,  important 

damages  may  occur  if  tubers  are  stored  in  bad  conditions  (Cwalina-Ambroziak, 

2002). There was no study on the development of atypical blemishes during storage 

but generally fast drying of tubers after harvesting permits to avoid the development 

of  several  diseases  (Scheid,  2006).  Unfortunately,  cultural  management  practices 

alone are not currently fully efficient to control diseases, causing the potato industry 

to  become  over-reliant  on  the  use  of  agrochemicals  for  effective  management. 

Current research efforts are directed at the identification and incorporation of genetic

resistance into cultivars with acceptable agronomical characteristics to provide more 

effective disease management (Gudmestad et al., 2007). 

The  appropriate  analyses  of  the  databases  built  up  during  the  previous  proposal  of 

perspective  supported  by  the  built  up  of  mathematical  models  would  be  in  perfect 

adequacy with the philosophy developed within the ENDURE network. Development 

of integrated pest management could be a sustainable solution to produce potatoes 

that will respond to the preoccupations of all the potato industry that aim at producing 

a  fresh  mass  consumer  product  with  high  qualitative  and  quantitative  yields,  good 

presentation and environment friendly modes of production (Figure 7.1).
