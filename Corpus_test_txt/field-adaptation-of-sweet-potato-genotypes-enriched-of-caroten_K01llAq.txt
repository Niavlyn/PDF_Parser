ABSTRACT: Most sweet potato genotypes marketed in Brazil have white, yellow or cream pulp color 
with  negligible  carotenoid  contents.  The  use  of  beta-carotene  rich  sweet  potato  materials  may  contribute  to 
improve  people  welfare,  especially  those  at  critical  nutritional  conditions.  The  yield-related  traits  and 
marketable  tuber  quality  of  10  beta-carotene  biofortified  (or  not)  sweet  potato  genotypes  were  assessed  in  a 
Brazilian Cerrado area.  Differences for all traits were found, with some materials prevailing. However, four of 
them (CNPH 1190, CNPH 1206, CNPH 1210 and CNPH 1310) showed good adaptability. CNPH 1210 had the 
highest yield (52.21 ton ha-1), 4.28 times higher than the Brazilian sweet potato average yield. CNPH 1210 and 
CNPH  1310  had  the  highest  tuber  numbers  and  the  most  preferred  mass  class  for  consumers,  and  therefore, 
they furnished the best marketable genotypes. Nevertheless, the materials CNPH 1210 and CNPH 1310 (both 
orange-fleshed  sweet  potatoes)  stood  out  for  tuber  market  quality.  Our  results  may  stimulate  organized  civil 
society  efforts  to  improve  the  production  and  consumption  of  beta-carotene-rich  sweet  potato  materials  in 
municipalities in the Brazilian Cerrado.

INTRODUCTION

Sweet  potato 

(Ipomoea  batatas  L.) 
(Convolvulaceae)  is  the  fourth  most  consumed 
vegetable in Brazil, and the sixth most popular and 
abundant  vegetable  in  the  world  (MUSSOLINE; 
WILKIE,  2016).  This  plant  has  relatively  low 
production  cost,  requires  minimal  investments  in 
technology,  and  provides  a  high  financial  return. 
Sweet potato is mainly cultivated by small familiar 
farmers,  such  as 
located  at  developing 
countries,  without  necessarily  using  genetically 
improved varieties (OLIVEIRA et al., 2008). Sweet 
potato  is  an  important  dietary  component  for 
populations  with  food  limitation,  due  to  its  high 
nutritional  values,  including  sugars,  dietary  fibers, 
vitamins  and  minerals  (SILVA  et  al.,  2010).  The 
leaves  have  antioxidant  activity,  suppressing  low-
density lipoprotein oxidation (NAGAI et al., 2011). 
Since  2006,  Embrapa  CNPH  (National 
Center  for  Vegetable  Research)  researchers  have 
selected  carotenoid-rich  (such  as  ß-carotene)  sweet 
potato  materials.  This  substance  is  a  primary 
pigment  molecule  and  provitamin  A  source 
(MELÉNDEZ-MARTÍNEZ  et  al.,  2007)  with  high

antioxidant  capacity  by  eliminating  free  radicals, 
due  to  conjugated  double  bonds  (FU  et  al.,  2011). 
This  research  is  part  of  the  Biofortification  Project 
(Brazilian  Biofortification 
of  Embrapa-Biofort 
Program) 
food 
international 
biofortification  programs,  the  HaverstPlus  and  the 
AgroSalud.  These  programs  aim  at  developing 
natural  foods  with  nutrient  quantities  meeting  the 
nutritional  needs  of  the  human  body  (LAURIE  et 
al.,  2015).  The  project  also  developed  rice,  beans, 
corn,  cassava,  pumpkin  and  wheat  with  higher 
nutrient  contents. 
In  2010,  Embrapa  CNPH 
recommended  the  usage  of  orange-fleshed  sweet 
potato (Beauregard) in Brazil (variety CNPH 1205, 
assessed in the present survey), normally used in the 
United  States  (VANESBROECK  et  al.,  2008)  and 
registered  by  the  Brazilian  Ministry  of  Agriculture, 
Livestock and Supply (MAPA, 2016). 

In  Brazil  and  Ghana,  the  most  preferred 
sweet  potato  varieties  have  white,  yellow  or  cream 
flesh  (OFORI  et  al.,  2009)  with  insignificant 
carotene  levels  compared  to  the  orange-fleshed 
ones,  with  carotene  values  comparable  to  those  of

have  the  same  preference  (NWANKWO  et  al., 
2014).  In  China,  the  four  most  common  sweet 
potato  materials  have  white,  yellow,  orange  and 
purple  flesh,  with  different  chemical  compositions 
(JUNG et al., 2014). 

 
The  experiment  consisted  of  a  completely 
randomized block design with four replications. The 
treatments  were  10  sweet  potato  genotypes  from 
Embrapa  CNPH,  kept  in  Gama,  Distrito  Federal, 
Brazil. Sweet potato genotypes are visually separated 
by their inner and outside color and leaf morphology 
(Table 1). 
. 

The  use  of  β-carotene  enriched  materials 
can  help  population  nutrition,  especially  those  in 
critical  nutritional  situation.  The  purpose  of  the 
present study was to compare yield traits and tuber 
quality  of  β-carotene  biofortified  (or  not)  sweet 
potato  genotypes 
in  a  Cerrado  Savanna-type 
environment of Brazil, at Goiás state.

The  soil,  Red  Yellow  Dystrophic type,  was 
collected  before  experiment  installation  at  0  to  0.20 
m depth, and presented the following characteristics: 
pH  in  water  of  6.01;  Ca,  Mg,  K,  H+Al  of  0.2,  1.8, 
0.43, and 5.8 cmolc dm-3, respectively; P of 0.67 mg

and granulometry of 226.2, 209.8, and 564.0 g kg-1 of 
clay,  silt  and  sand,  respectively.  Soil  preparation 
consisted  of  forming  30  cm  furrow,  spaced  80  cm 
apart,  by  using  a  bedshaper  coupled  with  a  rotary 
hoe.  These  beds  were  separated  in  half  each  one, 
forming  the  furrows  with  the  dimensions  described.

No plowing was required and only a rotary hoe was 
used to loose soil and weed elimination 

The  experimentation  was  held  out  from 
November  2015  to  April  2016,  in  a  600  m2 
experimental  area,  and  the  propagating  material 
consisted of seed-stems (called seedlings) with six to 
eight internodes (about 30 centimeter). Each plot had 
five  4  m  furrows,  spaced  80  cm  between  them,  and 
33 cm between plants (three plants per linear meter). 
Plots were spaced by one meter. 

The fertilization consisted of a 60-120-90 kg 
ha-1 of N, P2O5 and K2O, respectively, formula with 
all the phosphorus applied at planting and the N and 
K2O  in  portions,  half  at  planting  time  and  half  at 
coverage, when seedlings began to sprout (about four 
to  five  weeks  after  grafting).  This  fertilization 
formula  meets  the  nutritional  requirements  of  sweet

tubers  were  individually  categorized  according  to 
their  mass  in  seven  classes:  extra  A  (between  301

and  shoot  dry  mass  (F=  8.28,  df=  9,  P=  0.00) 
differed between sweet potato genotypes (Table 2). 
CNPH  1206  had  highest  shoot  fresh  mass,  82.89  ± 
2.79 tons ha-1 and CNPH 1205 the lowest (33.19 ± 
1.08 ton ha-1). The other genotypes had intermediate 
values: 41.46 ton ha-1 (CNPH 1190) to 54.17 ton ha-
1  (CNPH  1340).  The  shoot  dry  mass  showed  a 
similar  response.  The  materials  CNPH  1206  and 
CNPH  1205  presented  the highest (8.46  ±  0.26 ton

(Table  3).  CNPH  1310  (with  the  highest  tuber 
numbers) produced 10.67 times more tubers than the 
CNPH 1340 (with the lowest tuber number) (Table 
3). CNPH 1310 yielded about 3.5, 2.6, 1.6, 4.0, 2.3, 
3.7,  2.5  and  six  times  more  tubers  than  the  CNPH 
1190,  CNPH  1195,  CNPH  1205,  CNPH  1206 
CNPH  1210,  CNPH  1304,  CNPH  1338  and  CNPH 
1362, respectively. 

The  material  CNPH  1210  had  the  highest 
yield,  52.21  ton  ha-1  (F=  48.89,  df=  9,  P=  0,00) 
(Table  3).  The  yield  of  the  other  genotypes  ranged 
between 13.93 ton ha-1 (CNPH 1206) and 47.43 ton 
ha-1  (CNPH  1205).  CNPH  1340  genotype  had  the 
lowest yield (7.45 ton ha-1) (Table 3). 

Fresh  mass  (F=  5.46,  df=  9,  P=  0.00)  and 
dry  mass  (F=  8.08,  df=  9,  P=  0.00)  of  five 
commercial  tubers  differed  between  each  other 
(Table  3).  CNPH  1310  and  CNPH  1210  genotypes 
produced  heavier  tubers,  while  the  dry  mass  of  the 
CNPH 1190 and CNPH 1206 tubers were heavier.

DISCUSSION 
 

in  Umudike,  Abia 

In  general,  clear  flesh  sweet  potato  clones 
have  higher  shoot  weight  yield  than  β-carotene-
enriched  ones.  Our  results  are  similar  to  those 
reported 
state,  Nigeria 
(NWANKWO  et  al.,  2014).  Sweet  potato  tubers 
have  undoubtedly  higher  added  value  for  the  food 
industry  and  in  natura  consumption,  but  shoot  is 
important  as  food  for  domesticated  animals.  Sweet 
potato  leaves  and  stems  have  high  crude  protein 
content  and  good  digestibility  for  dairy  or  beef 
cattle,  as  fresh  leaves and silage  (GONÇALVES  et 
al.,  2011;  VIANA  et  al.,  2011).  In  Southeast  Asia, 
sweet  potato leaves  are  consumed  as  vegetables by 
the  population  (NAGAI  et  al.,  2011).  Tubers  with 
pale  yellow  or  white  flesh  are  more  suitable  to 
manufacture flour or feeding domesticated animals, 

because they are less sweet than those with purple, 
reddish  or  orange  flesh  clones  (MUSSOLINE; 
WILKIE, 2016).  

The  high  viability  of 

the  biofortified 
genotype CNPH 1210 is important, since this study 
used  manual  planting  system  (seed-stems),  what  is 
more rustic, and therefore, more susceptible to plant 
establishment  failures.  This  material  can  also  be 
studied for clonal seedlings in tissue cultures similar 
to  the  potato  seedling  production  system  (Solanum 
tuberosum  L.)  (Solanaceae)  (HOQUE  et  al.,  1996). 
Besides,  the  adaptability  and  resistance  of  the 
CNPH 1210 seedlings should be better investigated 
because  sweet  potato  planting  and  production 
system  adopted  in  many  countries  worldwide  is 
mechanized. 

The  yield  obtained,  7.45  to  52.21  ton  ha-1 
for  genotypes  CNPH  1340  and  CNPH  1210,

respectively,  differ  from  the  Brazilian  average 
(11.80 ton ha-1) (IBGE, 2016). The genotype CNPH 
1340 had a yield similar to that in Nigeria (7 ton ha-
1)  (NWANKWO  et  al.,  2014).  The  CNPH  1210 
material  reached  four  times  the  Brazilian  mean 
yield,  highlighting  it  as  a  promising  material. 
Biofortified  sweet  potato  varieties  have  been  used 
for  their  productive  potential,  as  the  Beauregard 
the  main  ß-carotene-enriched  cultivar 
cultivar, 
produced  in  the  United  States  (PHILLIPS  et  al., 
2005;  VANESBROECK  et  al.,  2008).  This 
information  differs  from  the  report  that  carotene-
biofortified  genotypes  had  lower  yield  than  non-
biofortified  ones  in  Vale  do  Jequitinhonha,  Minas 
Gerais  state,  Brazil  (ANDRADE  JUNIOR  et  al., 
2009).  This  demonstrates 
importance  of 
considering  the  adaptation  of  ß-carotene-enriched 
sweet potato materials in other Brazilian regions to 
define  a  yield  criterion  for  this  harvest.  However, 
the  highest  genotype  CNPH  1210  yield  can  be  an 
their 
important  criterion  to  farmers 
cultivation,  supply  this  product  to  market,  and 
consequently,  the  consumption  of  this  material  by 
the population.  

increasing 

the 

The  tuber  numbers  can  be  used  to  predict 
the  yield  potential  of  a  given  genotype  because  a 
positive  correlation  between  yield  and 
tuber 
numbers  (GASURA  et  al.,  2008;  MOTSA  et  al., 
2015).  However,  the  increase  in  tuber  numbers 
decreases its dry matter content, since the plant may 
not  obtain  photoassimilates  necessary  for  all  tubers 
to gain mass. In such cases, the production of a few 
standard size tubers is preferred instead of many low 
mass tubers. 

In  Brazil, 

for  example,  no  official 
commercial standard has been established for sweet 
the  existing  classification  system 
potato,  but 
considers  the  demands  of  large  consumer  markets 
(Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo) with tuber mass as a 
reference.  In  general,  Brazilian  consumers  prefer 
smooth  and  elongated  sweet  potato  tubers,  and  do 
not  appreciate  very  large  or  very  small  ones.  The 
average preference indicates 12 to 16 cm long, 5 to 
8  cm  in  diameter,  and  200  to  400  g  of  tuber  fresh 
mass.  At  purchase,  the  visual  aspects  influence 
selecting  this  product,  and  the  decision  on  buying 
fruits  and  vegetables  is  based  on  their  appearance 
(ABBOTT et al., 2015). The materials CNPH 1205, 
CNPH  1210,  CNPH  1310,  and  CNPH  1362  had 
high  tuber  yield  classified  as  miscellaneous  and 

characteristics  of 

discard.  However,  these  materials  can  be  used  for 
industrial  processing  because  they  also  present 
nutritional 
the 
commercially  desirable  classes  (CARDOSO  et  al., 
2005).  Clones  with  higher  dry  mass  (such  as  the 
non-biofortified  genotypes  CNPH  1206  and  CNPH 
1190) have higher sale value for industrial purposes 
(QUEIROGA et al., 2007). 

tubers  of 

The Brazilian consumer preference by sweet 
potatoes  with  pale  flesh  and  white,  pink  or  purple 
skin  (Filgueira,  2013)  has  been  changed  due  to  the 
nutritional  advantages  of  ß-carotene-enriched sweet 
tubers,  a  substance  which  benefits  humans  as  a 
vitamin  A  precursor  (MAIANI  et  al.,  2009).  Thus, 
the consumption of these last sweet potatoes should 
be  encouraged,  especially  as  food  for  people  at 
in  Brazil  and  other  developing 
nutrition  risk 
countries  (SILVA  et  al.,  2010).  South  African 
companies,  private  organizations  and  human 
nutrition, public sectors have invested in boosting ß-
consumption 
carotene-enriched 
(LAURIE  et  al.,  2015).  This  confirms  a  typical 
characteristic  of  sweet  potatoes  breeding  programs 
in  Brazil  as  found  in  other  tropical  regions  in  the 
world (VILLAREAL; JO, 1983): the existence of a 
vast  germplasm  bank  what  facilitates  finding 
materials meeting different requirements.

CONCLUSIONS 
 

The  yield  and  qualitative  parameters  of  ß-
carotene-enriched  (or  not)  sweet  potato  genotypes 
strongly differed from each other.  

The  non-biofortified  genotype  CNPH  1206 
(white-fleshed)  presented  the  highest  shoot  fresh 
and dry mass yield and the CNPH 1310 and CNPH 
1210 (both orange-fleshed) the highest tuber number 
and  yield,  respectively.  CNPH  1210  also  showed 
high  tuber  numbers  with  fresh  mass  classified  with 
highest value in the Brazilian marketplace.  

In  pragmatic  terms,  familiar-based  farmers 
can  profit  from  the  cultivation  of  ß-carotene  rich, 
sweet  potato  materials  because  this  plant  requires 
management with a depressed degree of technology. 
Our  results  may  stimulate  efforts  to  improving  the 
production  and  consumption  of  ß-carotene  rich 
sweet  potato  materials  in  more  Brazilian  regions, 
such as those where Brazilian Cerrado Savanna-type 
environments predominates. 

 
 
RESUMO: A maioria dos genótipos de batata-doce comercializados no Brasil tem cor de polpa branca, 
amarela ou creme, com conteúdo desprezível de carotenóides. O uso de materiais de batata-doce ricos em beta-
caroteno  pode  contribuir  para  melhorar  o  bem-estar  das  pessoas,  especialmente  aquelas  em  condições

nutricionais críticas. Características relacionadas ao rendimento e a qualidade comercial dos tubérculos de 10 
genótipos de batata-doce biofortificada (ou não) com beta-caroteno foram avaliadas em uma área do Cerrado 
brasileiro. Diferenças para todas as características foram encontradas, com alguns materiais predominantes. No 
entanto, quatro deles (CNPH 1190, CNPH 1206, CNPH 1210 e CNPH 1310) mostraram boa adaptabilidade. O 
CNPH 1210 teve o maior rendimento (52,21 ton ha-1), 4,28 vezes maior que o rendimento nacional médio da 
batata-doce brasileira. CNPH 1210 e CNPH 1310 tiveram o maior número de tubérculos e a classe de massa 
mais  preferida  para  os  consumidores  e,  portanto,  forneceram  os  melhores  genótipos  comercializáveis.  No 
entanto, os materiais CNPH 1210 e CNPH 1310 (ambos batata-doce de polpa alaranjada) destacaram-se pela 
qualidade dos tubérculos comerciais. Nossos resultados podem estimular esforços da sociedade civil organizada 
para  melhorar  a  produção  e  consumo  de  materiais  de  batata-doce  ricos  em  beta-caroteno  em  municípios 
contidos no Cerrado brasileiro.
