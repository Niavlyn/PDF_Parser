Social  associations  among  individuals  can  reveal  behavioral  strategies  that  maximize  an 
individual’s  fitness  (van  Schaik  1989,  Silk  et  al.  2003,  Frere  et  al.  2010a,  Kappeler  et  al. 
2013). Possible advantages of social bonds include decreased predation risks, cooperation 
to catch and defend resources, transfer of information, care for another, or increased calf 
survival.  Disadvantages 
include  competition  for  resources  or  mates,  facilitated 
transmission  of  pathogens,  and  increased  aggression  or  infanticide  rates  (see  detailed 
review in Krause and Ruxton 2002). The trade-off between the costs and benefits incurred 
is influenced by predation risks, the availability of resources including habitat, prey, and 
access  to  mates,  and  density  dependent  factors  (Alexander  1974,  Rubenstein  and 
Wrangham 1986). Hence, ecological variability such as the availability of suitable habitat 
or  food  resources  may  shape  social  variability  in  terrestrial  and  marine  mammals 
(Karczmarski et al. 2005, Wittemyer et al. 2005). For instance, ecological factors may have 
a strong influence on the social structure of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops spp. (Connor et 
al. 2000). These species form fission-fusion communities (i.e., we consider a community as 
an entity formed of individuals of the same species that co-occur in space and time and 
have an opportunity to interact), where associations among individuals are fluid and highly 
dynamic (Connor et al. 2000). The strength of dyadic associations can be measured using 
the half-weight index (HWI), which corresponds to the number of times a pair of individuals 
was observed in the same group over the number of times the individuals were observed 
in different groups. It ranges from 0 (individuals were never associated) to 1 (they were 
always associated). In most bottlenose dolphin communities, the mean HWI is low, around 
0.1  indicating  a  low  frequency  of  associations  among  individuals  (Connor  et  al.  2000, 
Wiszniewski et al. 2009, Bouveroux and Mallefet 2010, Daura-Jorge et al. 2012, Louis et al. 
2015). However, in some communities, a small number of individuals form strong and long-
term  associations  (such  as  alliances  between  males)  that  are  thought  to  be  shaped  by 
ecological factors, kin selection, or mating strategies, or a combination of those (Kreutzen 

 
et  al.  2003;  Frere  et  al.  2010b;  Wiszniewski  et  al.  2010,  2012;  Connor  et  al.  2011). 
Additionally, the Doubtful Sound (New Zealand) and the Sado estuary (Portugal) dolphin 
communities  have  a  stable  fission-fusion  social  structure  with  strong  bonds  recorded 
between most individuals (Lusseau et al. 2003, Augusto et al. 2011). Such social structure 
is uncommon for these species and may be shaped by resource availability (Lusseau et al. 
2003, Augusto et al. 2011). Studying the social structure of additional bottlenose dolphin 
communities may help to better understand its drivers in this species. 
Our  study  focused  on  a  small  bottlenose  dolphin  community,  which  was  first  recorded 
around Sein Island, Brittany, France in the 1980s and monitored until 2001 for population 
size and habitat use. The community was small (20 individuals in 
2001) and used a mean area of 6 km2 as determined by focal follow data (Liret et al. 2006). 
No  movements  were  recorded  between  the  Sein  Island  community  and  the  closest 
bottlenose dolphin community of the Molene Archipelago, which is situated around 40 km 
north of Sein Island (Liret et al. 2006). Following the creation of a marine protected area 
(MPA),  Parc  naturel  marin  d’Iroise  (PNMI),  an  ongoing  photoidentification  monitoring 
effort was implemented from 2014 onward for estimating demographic parameters and 
habitat  use.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  update  census  size,  investigate  social 
structure, and estimate the home range of this community using photo-identification data. 
Photo-identification data were collected around Sein Island (Fig. 1) from August 2014 to 
October 2015 during 28 sampling days with good weather conditions (Beaufort sea state ≤ 
3).  The  island  is  located  8  km  from  the  coast  of  France  (Brittany  region).  The  area  is 
characterized by shallow waters (depth ranges from <1–30 m), strong tidal currents and a 
variety of benthic habitats including numerous rocks covered by algae, gravel and maerl 
bottoms, or sandy sediments. Recordings from the boat during the surveys using MaxSea 
Marine Navigation Software indicated current speeds of 3–4 kn and up to 5.2 kn during an 
equinox  high  tide.  Given  the  strong  currents  and  numerous  submerged  rocks  it  was 
impossible to design line-transect surveys. However, efforts were made to survey the area 
consistently across the surveys. A typical survey route included a loop around the island 
and driving around all the rocks on the western part where the route extended 8 km west 
of the island. Surveys were conducted at a speed of 5–10 kn from an 8 m rigid inflatable 
boat with two or three observers aboard, including one photographer. For the purposes of 
this work a group of dolphins was defined as all individuals moving in the same direction 
and engaged in a similar behavioral activity, that were within a 100 m radius from each 
other (Wells et al. 1987). When a group of dolphins was sighted, photographs of the dorsal 
fins and upper backs of encountered individuals were taken by the same observer using a 
Nikon D300S with a 120–400 mm lens. Photo-identification work usually ended when the 
photographer  decided  that  he  had  photos  of  all  the  individuals,  or  more  rarely  when 
dolphins  showed  boat  avoidance  behaviors.  Efforts  were  made  to  photo-identify  all 
individuals in the group, which was relatively straightforward given the small size of the 
community. Photo-identification data treatment was performed by the same observer and 
followed standardized protocols (Hammond et al. 1990). Individuals were identified from 
good and very good quality photographs (i.e., in focus, fin entirely visible, angle at ca. 90 
or 270). Photos of all individuals were arranged in a catalog, keeping the best and most 
recent  photo  for  each  individual.  The  best  photo  for  each  individual  per  survey  was 
selected and was matched to the identity catalog of all individuals. All individuals could be 
recognized using their natural marks (i.e., notches and scars) on both sides of their dorsal 
fins, therefore, no individual was excluded from the analyses based on its level of markings. 
Group sizes were inconsistently recorded in the field and were therefore estimated as the 
number of identified individuals in the photographs for each encountered group. 

 
Social  structure  analyses  were  run  using  the  SOCPROG  2.4  program  (Whitehead  2009) 
implemented in Matlab version 7.6.0. (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). A day was considered 
as the sampling period to avoid demographic effects. We restricted the analysis to adults 
sighted on more than 10 sampling periods (i.e., survey days) to avoid bias linked to sample 
size and rarely encountered individuals. Calves (i.e., individuals whose age was estimated 
to be <2 yr due to known birth year according to their first sighting, presence of fetal folds 
or lines, size and close and repetitive contact with the mother) were excluded as their social 
affiliations are linked to their mothers. Opportunistic photo-identification data collected in 
2013  were  used  to  help  determine  the  year  of  birth  of  the  calves.  Individuals  were 
considered as associates if they were observed in the same group during a sampling period.

marin d’Iroise) is indicated. The areas where resident bottlenose dolphin communities are observed

The  HWI  was  used  to  quantify  the  strength  of  associations  between  pairs  of  individual 
dolphins. This index minimizes bias when all the associates are not identified (Cairns and 
Schwager 1987). Although efforts were made to photograph all individuals present in the 
group,  using  the  HWI  accounted  for  eventually  missed  individuals  and  is  therefore 
conservative.  Additionally,  this  index  is  commonly  used  in  bottlenose  dolphin  social 
structure analyses, allowing comparisons among studies (e.g., Lusseau et al. 2003, Augusto 
et al. 2011, Daura-Jorge et al. 2012, Louis et al. 2015). The coefficient of variation of the 
HWI (S, the social differentiation) and the correlation coefficient of the true and estimated 
association  matrices  (r)  were  estimated  using  maximum  likelihood  procedures.  A  social 
differentiation of less than 0.3 indicates a homogenous society, and values of more than 
0.5 indicate a well differentiated society. Coefficient r indicates the power of the analysis 
to represent the true social structure, with 0 indicating an inaccurate representation and 1 
an  excellent  representation.  Standard  errors  (SE)  were  calculated  for  r  and  S  from 
bootstraps  with  1,000  replications.  A  Monte  Carlo  permutation  test  was  conducted  to 

 
determine  whether  observed  association  indices  were  higher  than  expected  by  chance 
(Bejder et al. 1998; Whitehead 1999, 2008). The matrix of observed association indices was 
permutated within sampling periods until P stabilized at 10,000 permutations with 1,000 
flips. A higher standard deviation (SD) of the observed association indices in comparison 
with  the  SD  of  permutated  data  indices  indicates  that  preferred  and/or  avoided 
associations are present in the community (Whitehead 1999, 2008). The social structure of 
the community was then examined using a hierarchical cluster analysis with the average 
linkage  algorithm  on  the  association  data.  A  cluster  with  a  cophenetic  correlation 
coefficient  (CCC)  higher  than  0.8  indicates  a  good  representation  of  social  structure 
(Whitehead 2008). We tested whether there was any subdivision in the community using 
modularity coefficient, Q, (Newman 2004, Whitehead 2008). Modularity was defined as 
the difference between the proportion of the total association measured within clusters 
vs. the expected proportion if pairwise association indices were randomly distributed. A 
modularity coefficient ≥0.3 indicates significant division among clusters (Newman 2004). 
We also displayed the social structure as a sociogram showing association indices between 
individuals that are ≥0.5. 

Home range was estimated for the entire community using the fixed kernel-density method 
(Worton 1989) in R 3.2.3 (R Core Team 2015) using the adehabitatHR package (Calenge 
2006). The data were the same as those used for social structure analyses (i.e., we only 
kept the first sighting if a group was sighted more than once during a day and excluded 
groups  for  which  no  photos  were  taken  to  avoid  duplicates).  The  resolution  of  the 
smoothing parameter (i.e., the bandwidth value) was estimated using the ad hoc method. 
The  home  range  was  defined  using  a  95%  contour  line  and  the  core  area  using  a  50% 
contour line. 
Field work was carried out all year round (4 surveys in the winter, 5 in spring, 15 in summer, 
and 4 in autumn; Fig. 2). Eighty groups were sighted during 28 sampling days (dolphins 
were sighted during each survey). Thirteen groups were excluded as they were resightings 
of the same group observed earlier in the day. Seven groups were discarded because no 
photos were taken or the conditions (i.e., individuals showed boat avoidance behavior or 
currents were particularly strong) made it too difficult to get good quality photographs, 
and four groups were excluded because they did not include individuals sighted in more 
than 10 d. Thus, 56 groups sighted during 25 sampling days were included in the analysis. 
During a survey day, one main large group was typically observed, with a mean number of 
16.4 identified individuals (SD = 5.2) as well as smaller subgroups of one or a few individuals 
(x = 2.7, SD = 1.9). 
Thirty-three  dolphins  were  identified  over  the  study  period  (2014–2015)  including  24 
adults  or  subadults  (referred  as  adults  thereafter)  and  9  calves.  The  discovery  curve 
indicated that all adults were rapidly identified after the first surveys (Fig. 2). Census size 
was  29  individuals,  including  24  adults  and  5  calves  in  2014  (mark-recapture  analyses 
resulted  in  exactly  the  same  estimation,  Louis  and  Ridoux  2015),  and  31  individuals 
including 24 adults and 7 calves in 2015. All 24 adults sighted in 2014 were resighted in 
2015, suggesting interannual site fidelity. Two adults out of 24 were excluded from the 
social structure analyses as they did not meet the more than 10 sampling day threshold 
(they were only observed on 3 and 8 d, respectively). For the 22 remaining individuals, the 
mean number of sampling days where an individual was recorded was 17.1 (SD = 3.1). 
The  estimated  social  differentiation  (S)  was  0.47  (SE  =  0.06),  indicating  a  moderately  to 
well-differentiated  society.  The  correlation  coefficient  (r)  of  the  true  and  estimated 
association matrices was 0.87 (SE = 0.03), indicating a good power to represent the social 

 
structure. The mean HWI was 0.50 (SD = 0.27). This SD was higher than that obtained for 
the  permuted  data  set  (SD  =  0.25,  P  <  0.001),  indicating  that  the  individuals  did  not 
associate at random and that there were long-term preferred or avoided associates in the 
community. The cluster cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) was 0.96, which indicates 
an  effective  social  structure  representation  (Fig.  3a).  Most  individuals  were  sighted 
together 50% of the time (Fig. 3b). In addition, both the cluster diagram and the sociogram 
indicate one core social entity composed by the majority of the individuals, a smaller entity 
of  three  individuals  and  more  solitary  individuals  (Fig.  3a,  b).  However,  there  was  no 
significant division in the community, the maximum modularity (Q) was 0.08. Including the 
individual sighted on only eight sampling days in the analyses did not change any of the 
results significantly (results not shown). 
The home range of the community was 33.5 km² (95% kernel) and the core area was 5.6 
km²  (50%  kernel,  Fig.  1).  It  should  also  be  noted  that  extensive  field  work  for  other 
environmental or species monitoring was carried out by the MPA fieldwork team in other 
areas around the island, further offshore from the island, and along the coast of Brittany; 
and  the  bottlenose  dolphins  were  never  sighted  there  (MB,  personal  observation).  The 
photo-identification  catalog  of  this  community  was  compared  with  the  catalogs  of  the 
communities of the Molene archipelago (PNMI catalog, Brittany, France, Atlantic Ocean) 
and of the Normano-Breton Gulf (Groupe d’Etude des Cetaces du Cotentin catalog, Brittany 
and Normandy, France, English Channel). No matches were found. 
The mean association index of 0.5 in this community is one of the highest ever recorded in 
published  studies  on  bottlenose  dolphins  (mean  HWI  were  0.45  and  0.47  in  the  Sado 
estuary and Doubtful Sound communities, respectively; Lusseau et al. 2003, Augusto et al. 
2011) while the core home range is one of the smallest. Although no significant community 
division has been detected, both field observations and social structure analyses indicated 
one  main  social  group  composed  of  the  majority  of  the  individuals  that  were  tightly 
associated  (HWI  ≥  0.5)  and  individuals  that  were  more  solitary  or  observed  in  smaller 
groups. The co-occurrence of these contrasting grouping patterns may reflect contrasting 
balances  between  the  costs  and  benefits  of  living  in  groups  for  different  individuals 
(Kappeler  et  al.  2013).  The  small  groups  usually  did  not  include  calves.  It  would  be 
interesting to determine the sex of the individuals as well as the behavioral state of each 
group to better understand the forces driving these different grouping patterns. Individuals 
also appeared to show strong site fidelity, and this observation should be confirmed with 
data collected in additional years. A large amount of time has elapsed between the current 
data  and  the  dedicated  surveys  of  the  mid-1990s;  it  was  thus  not  possible  to  reliably 
compare the two catalogs to further investigate site fidelity. The current data set spanned 
over  15  mo,  which  was  not  enough  to  fit  models  of  temporal  stability  of  association 
patterns. 
Several  factors  may  drive  the  relatively  atypical  social  structure  observed  here  for  the 
species. First, demographic factors may play role (Lehmann and Boesch 2004). As the size 
of this dolphin community is small, individuals may have more opportunities to associate 
with all the other individuals. However, even if the community size is small, it is possible to 
observe  low  average  coefficients  of  associations  if  the  typical  group  size  is  small.  As  an 
example, the mean HWI among 35 bottlenose dolphins in an estuary in Brazil was 0.05 
(Daura-Jorge et al. 2012). Therefore, demographic factors alone cannot explain the strong 
associations  observed  among  individuals.  Ecological  factors,  in  particular  resource 
availability  (food  and/or  habitat),  may  be  important  drivers  of  social  structure  variation 
both among and within social mammal communities (Karczmarski et al. 2005, Henzi et al. 
2009, Beck et al. 2012, Foster et al. 2012). Here, the small core area used by the community 

 
and the site fidelity of the individuals suggested that prey may be abundant, which possibly 
limited trophic competition among individuals. Benefits of living in a group may therefore 
outweigh the cost, promoting strong social bonds between individuals and the use of a 
small core area as suggested for the Sado estuary bottlenose dolphin community (Augusto 
et al. 2011). In addition, winter conditions can be harsh as this open habitat is regularly 
exposed to strong storms and currents. Calves were not included in the social structure 
analyses, but were generally observed in the large main group. Two of the three calves 
born  in  2013  disappeared  during  winter  2014–2015  (unpublished  data).  Although  data 
were  limited  during  winter,  strong  bonds  among  individuals  may  promote  care  and 
protection of the calves. Calf survival is positively influenced by strong and stable bonds 
between adult females in primates and bottlenose dolphin societies (Silk et al. 2009, Frere 
et al. 2010a). Predation is unlikely to influence association patterns as no shark bites were 
ever recorded; this is in contrast to populations exposed to shark attacks (Heithaus 2001). 
Kin  selection  (Hamilton  1964)  may  also  play  a  role  in  shaping  the  strong  social  bonds 
observed in this community. Between 1994 and 2001, the size of the community increased 
from 14 to 21 individuals, and this increase corresponded solely to new calves that stayed 
in  the  community  (Liret  et  al.  2006),  which  is  likely  to  have  created  opportunities  for 
associating with kin. As mentioned above, we could not compare the current data with the 
mid-1990s to further investigate this hypothesis. To sum up, the social structure of this 
community  might  be  shaped  by  a  combination  of  a  small  group  size,  low  trophic 
competition, and environmental conditions. This hypothesis could be further investigated 
by collecting environmental and behavioral data. 
Finally,  this  study  provided  an  updated  status  on  the  census  size  of  the  Sein  Island 
bottlenose dolphin community that has doubled in size since first census size count using 
photo-identification data in the same area from 14 individuals in 1992 (Liret 2001) to 31 
individuals  in  2015.  The  community  seemed,  according  to  photo-identification  data, 
isolated  from  the  other  resident  bottlenose  dolphin  communities  in  Brittany  and 
Normandy.  However,  information  on  genetic  connectivity  was  not  available.  The  small 
home and core range of the community make it particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic 
pressures, and thus increases the need to protect this habitat. This area is designated as a 
Special Area of Conservation (SAC) as part of the Natura 2000 Network (European Union 
Habitats  Directive,  92/43/EEC)  and  a  Marine  Natural  Park  under  the  French  regulation. 
Long-term  demographic  monitoring  is  needed  to  carefully  assess  the  health  of  this 
community, which is identified as one of the 16 bottlenose dolphin management units to 
be  assessed  in  the  European  Union  (ICES  2014)  for  the  Marine  Strategy  Framework 
Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC).
