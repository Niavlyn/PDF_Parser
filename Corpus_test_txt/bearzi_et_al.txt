The ecology and status of Risso’s dolphins Grampus griseus worldwide are poorly known. In the Mediter-
ranean Sea, modern ﬁeld studies of cetaceans only began in the late 1980s and this has resulted in rapid
advances in knowledge of some species, but not Risso’s dolphin. This paper reviews available informa-
tion on the distribution and ecology of Risso’s dolphins in the Mediterranean and identiﬁes factors that
may negatively affect them in this region. Risso’s dolphins occur in continental slope waters throughout
the Mediterranean basin and around many of the region’s offshore islands and archipelagos. No synop-
tic estimate of abundance is available for the Mediterranean region, but densities and overall numbers
are low in comparison to some other small odontocetes. Diet consists primarily of cephalopods, with a
clear preference for mesopelagic squid. The principal known threat to populations in the Mediterranean
is entanglement in pelagic drift gillnets. Other potential problems for Risso’s dolphins in the Mediter-
ranean include noise disturbance and ingestion of plastic debris. Conservation actions to mitigate the risk
of entanglement in ﬁshing gear are likely to beneﬁt Risso’s dolphins; speciﬁcally, the existing driftnet
ban in EU waters should be strictly enforced and extended to the high seas and to waters under non-EU
State jurisdiction. More and better data are needed on abundance, distribution, movements, population
dynamics and trends in Risso’s dolphin populations, and better information on threats (e.g. bycatch in
ﬁshing gear) is needed to inform conservation efforts.

Introduction

Risso’s dolphin Grampus griseus (Fig. 1) has been studied in sev-
eral locations around the world, but information on this cetacean
species remains relatively scant. Risso’s dolphins are not particu-
larly shy or elusive and can be studied with relative ease in areas
where continental slope waters are close to shore. In the Mediter-
ranean Sea they are relatively widespread (Gaspari and Natoli,
2006) but not abundant and their occurrence can be unpredictable,
possibly due to wide-ranging movements. This factor, together
with generally low densities, has precluded sustained, focussed
investigations of their ecology and behaviour. Even within the
few Mediterranean areas where Risso’s dolphins are known to be
consistently present, however, only limited information has been
obtained. In large parts of the region there is nothing more than
a few sightings or strandings to indicate their presence. In sum,
the distribution, ecology, status and trends of this species in the
Mediterranean remain somewhat mysterious. On one hand this
hampers conservation, but on the other hand it offers scope for
novel studies.

In the Mediterranean Sea, modern ﬁeld studies of cetaceans
began in the late 1980s (Notarbartolo di Sciara and Bearzi, 2005)
and this has resulted in rapid advances in knowledge of several
of the species known to occur regularly in the region (Reeves and
Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2006). Comprehensive reviews have been
published on the ﬁn whale Balaenoptera physalus (Notarbartolo di
Sciara et al., 2008a,b), the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops
truncatus (Bearzi et al., 2008), the short-beaked common dolphin
Delphinus delphis (Bearzi et al., 2003) and the striped dolphin
Stenella coeruleoalba (Aguilar, 2000). In addition, shorter accounts
are available for species that are rare or have a restricted geographic
distribution, such as the killer whale Orcinus orca (Notarbartolo di
Sciara, 1987) and the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena (Frantzis
et al., 2001; Rosel et al., 2003). The Risso’s dolphin, however,
remains one of the least-known cetacean species in the region and
has been the subject of few dedicated studies. A regional IUCN Red
List workshop in March 2006 concluded that the Mediterranean
subpopulation is Data Deﬁcient (Gaspari and Natoli, 2006).

The literature on Risso’s dolphins in the Mediterranean is limited
and the available information includes a number of contributions
that have not been formally peer-reviewed. Such ‘grey’ literature
was used only sparingly and selectively for this paper. Literature
from non-Mediterranean areas was assessed and summarised to
include the wider global context, integrate regional knowledge and
allow comparative insight. One of the main purposes of this review

Fig. 1. These Risso’s dolphins photographed in the Ligurian Sea show the characteristic morphology of the species: blunt head, robust foresection, long pectoral ﬁns (ﬂippers),
tall falcate dorsal ﬁn, anchor-shaped markings on the chest and dramatic scarring of adults, who turn almost white as they age. The right-bottom photo illustrates the

was to identify knowledge gaps and areas where focussed studies
should be conducted to inform conservation efforts in Mediter-
ranean waters.

Natural history

Risso’s dolphins have a distinctively shaped head, with no ‘beak’.
The melon is broad, squarish in proﬁle and creased in front by a
characteristic longitudinal furrow, thought to enable the animal
to produce a uniquely angled sonar beam (Philips et al., 2003).
The upper jaw projects slightly beyond the lower. The front half
of the body is more robust than the back half. The dorsal ﬁn is
tall, erect and moderately falcate. The ﬂippers are long and sickle-
shaped.

Adult Risso’s dolphins are heavily scarred, mostly from super-
ﬁcial wounds caused by the teeth of conspeciﬁcs. Depigmentation
can persist for a long time, and this facilitates species identiﬁca-
tion at sea and also allows individuals to be photo-identiﬁed. The
colour pattern changes remarkably with age (Fig. 1). Calves are grey

to brown at birth, darken as they grow and become lead grey, typ-
ically accumulating the whitish tooth rakes over much of the body
as they mature. Adults tend to lighten as they age and old animals
can appear almost completely white (Fig. 1). Risso’s dolphins have
reduced dentition that is specialised to capture cephalopods, their
main prey (Clarke, 1986). Functional teeth are absent in the upper
jaw but there are 2–7 pairs of relatively large, conical teeth in the
lower jaw. Exceptionally, small teeth are present in the upper jaw
(Cagnolaro et al., 1983; Kruse et al., 1999).

Risso’s dolphins are usually about 3 m long but can reach 4 m,
with no signiﬁcant sexual size dimorphism (Kruse et al., 1999).
Body size of animals in the Mediterranean does not seem to dif-
fer from that reported for other regions, although comparisons
are confounded to some extent by different measurement meth-
ods. In a sample of 126 individuals stranded in Italy between
1990 and 2009 and included in the Italian stranding database
(http://mammiferimarini.unipv.it/), adults (i.e. those exceeding the
mean length of the sample minus 1 SD, i.e. 207 cm) averaged 300 cm
(95% C.I. = 292–309, median 300.0, SD = 41.1, N = 101). The largest

individuals were between 325 and 354 cm long (N = 12), with only
one reaching 400 cm. The smallest individuals were 115–125 cm
long (N = 3). In a study of 18 animals (9 males and 9 females) from
the western Mediterranean Sea, the oldest individual was a male of
308 cm that had 29+ dentinal growth layer groups (Raduán et al.,
2007), each likely representing approximately 1 year (IWC, 1980, p.
30). The age of a 310-cm female stranded in Corsica was estimated
as 2.5 years based on dentine layers (Frodello et al., 2000).

A demographic model, using information from around the world
summarised by Kruse et al. (1999) and Perrin and Reilly (1984),
yielded estimates of age at ﬁrst reproduction of 11 years, inter-
birth interval of 2.4 years and oldest age of reproducing females of
38 years (Taylor et al., 2007). The survival rate of calves was esti-
mated as 0.87, adults 0.95 (Taylor et al., 2007). There is too little
information on reproduction in Mediterranean Risso’s dolphins to
allow generalisations or comparisons. One study based on 18 ani-
mals from the western Mediterranean estimated average length
at birth as 135 cm, with a gestation period of approximately 14
months (Raduán et al., 2007). Seasonality of births varies accord-
ing to geographic area (Jefferson et al., 1993; Kruse et al., 1999). In
the Mediterranean Sea most calves are probably born in the sum-
mer (Gaspari, 2004, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Demma, 2004). The
oldest Risso’s dolphin on record was estimated to be 34.5 years
old (Baird, 2009). Hybrids between Risso’s dolphins and common
bottlenose dolphins have been recorded both in captivity and in
the wild (Fraser, 1940; Shimura et al., 1986; Miyazaki et al., 1992;
Jefferson et al., 1993).

Risso’s dolphins observed in the Ligurian Sea during daytime
were mostly moving at about 6–7 km h−1, with surfacings of about
7–15 s followed by dives lasting 5–7 min, and occasionally longer
(Tethys Research Institute, unpublished data). A male that stranded
in Florida was satellite-tagged and followed for 23 days, during
which time 95% of its dives were to depths of less than 50 m and
only 1% were to depths greater than 200 m, with only a single dive
to 400–500 m (Wells et al., 2009). The animal spent more than 99%
of its time within 50 m of the surface and 99% of its dives lasted
less than 6 min (55% were between 2 and 4 min). The longest dives
lasted up to 9–10 min (Wells et al., 2009). Based on this recent
information, the maximal dive time of 30 min reported by Mörzer-
Bruyns (1971) and Clarke (1986, p. 304), and also cited in Kruse et
al. (1999, p. 200), should probably be regarded as questionable.

Risso’s dolphins can be energetic and active at the sea surface,
breaching (leaping clear of the water), porpoising (arching well
above the surface while swimming) and occasionally riding the bow
of a vessel (Jefferson et al., 1993). Spy-hopping to look at boats and
observers may occur. In the Mediterranean Sea they are often seen
‘head-standing’, i.e. staying almost motionless in a vertical position
with the tail stock out of the water, sometimes for 10–20 s (Tethys
Research Institute, unpublished data; Fig. 1). The reason behind this
behaviour is unknown.

The sound repertory of Risso’s dolphins includes a variety of
pulsed and whistle-like sounds used for both echolocation and
communication (Caldwell et al., 1969; Au, 1993; Corkeron and Van
Parijs, 2001). Echolocation clicks in free-ranging animals average
40 (cid:2)s with peak frequencies around 50 kHz and source levels of
202–222 dB re 1 (cid:2)Pa (peak to peak; Madsen et al., 2004). Risso’s
dolphins may be capable of hearing frequencies above 100 kHz
(Nachtigall et al., 2005).

Distribution

Risso’s dolphins can be found from the tropics through the tem-
perate regions in both hemispheres (Leatherwood et al., 1980;
Jefferson et al., 1993; Kruse et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2008). They
are rarely found in waters cooler than 10 ◦C (Kruse et al., 1999;
Baird, 2009). Seasonal patterns of distribution and numbers appear

to be associated with changes in prey availability and sea surface
temperature (Kruse et al., 1999).

In the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 2) the Risso’s dolphin is one
of eight cetacean species considered to be regular inhabitants
(Notarbartolo di Sciara and Demma, 2004; Reeves and Notarbartolo
di Sciara, 2006). Sightings have been reliably and consistently
reported from the waters of Spain (Ca ˜nadas et al., 2002, 2005;
Gannier, 2005), France (Di Méglio et al., 1999; Gannier, 2005),
Monaco (Azzellino et al., 2008), Italy (Notarbartolo di Sciara et al.,
1993) and Greece (Frantzis et al., 2003). Risso’s dolphins seem to
be rare in the Strait of Gibraltar and adjacent waters (Beaubrun and
Roussel, 2000; Villalba et al., 2000; De Stephanis et al., 2008). There
are a few sighting or stranding records from Morocco (Gannier,
2005), Algeria (Duguy et al., 1983; Boutiba, 1994), Malta (Vella,
1999a,b), Slovenia (Mazzatenta et al., 2005), Croatia (Bearzi et al.,
2004; Holcer et al., 2008), Turkey (Dede and Öztürk, 2007; Tonay
et al., 2009) and Israel (Goffman et al., 2000; Hadar et al., 2008).
Stranding records from some of these areas are included in the
MEDACES database (http://medaces.uv.es/). The species is rarely
sighted off Tunisia (Ktari-Chakroun, 1980; Chakroun, 1994). Risso’s
dolphins may be present off Libya, Egypt, Lebanon and Syria where
research effort has been low or nil. There is a single published record
of a stranded animal in Libya (Bearzi, 2006), another in Lebanon
(Gonzalvo, 2009) and none in Syria (Gonzalvo and Bearzi, 2008) or
Egypt. Risso’s dolphins do not occur in the Turkish Straits system
(Öztürk et al., 2009) or in the Black Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo
di Sciara, 2006).

Risso’s dolphins occur mainly in continental slope waters
throughout the Mediterranean basin as well as around many of
the region’s offshore islands and archipelagos. Most observations
have been in the northwestern part of the basin. In the Ligurian-
Corso-Provenc¸ al basin, during the summer, Risso’s dolphins are
found regularly in continental slope waters that in this part of the
Mediterranean occur mostly within 10 km, and in some areas only
a few km, from the coast (Di Méglio et al., 1999; Azzellino et al.,
2008). They are also observed regularly in the Alborán Sea and in
the Gulf of Vera, where their range includes deep offshore waters
(Ca ˜nadas et al., 2002, 2005). In the eastern Mediterranean, most
information comes from the Greek seas, where Frantzis et al. (2003)
reported a relatively homogeneous distribution of sightings and
suggested that Risso’s dolphins occur regularly in deep waters with
steep bottom relief. Sighting frequencies, however, were low and
the animals did not appear to be consistently present in any of the
areas surveyed (Frantzis et al., 2003). A few Risso’s dolphins have
been observed in mixed-species groups with striped dolphins and
short-beaked common dolphins in the deep waters of the semi-
closed Gulf of Corinth (Frantzis and Herzing, 2002; Azzolin et al.,
2010).

Population structure, numbers and trends

Based on mitochondrial DNA analyses, Risso’s dolphins in the
Mediterranean Sea are genetically differentiated from those in U.K.
waters, with limited gene ﬂow between the two areas (Gaspari
et al., 2007). Genetic analyses of 33 samples from the Mediter-
ranean region (27 from the Ligurian Sea) suggested relatively high
diversity (Gaspari et al., 2007). The study by Gaspari et al. (2007)
was not designed to reveal within-region population structure, but
other studies have found evidence of such structure in common
bottlenose dolphins (Natoli et al., 2005), short-beaked common
dolphins (Natoli et al., 2008) and striped dolphins (Fossi et al.,
2004; Gaspari et al., 2007). Taken together, those ﬁndings suggest
that physical boundaries such as the Strait of Gibraltar (minimum
width about 45 km and sill depths less than 145 m) and the much
wider Sicily Channel (143 km and sill depths less than 200 m) as
well as differences in habitat characteristics tend to restrict the

movements of some delphinids, leading to population structure.
Further research is needed to characterise population structure of
Risso’s dolphins within the Mediterranean as well as the degree of
genetic exchange with animals in the Atlantic. The species’ failure
to colonise the Black Sea could be explained by the lack of suit-
able habitat in the Turkish Straits system (Dardanelles minimum
width about 450 m, sill depths less than 55 m) or, perhaps more
importantly, by the remarkable absence of cephalopods (Nixon and
Young, 2003; Jereb and Roper, 2005).

The Risso’s dolphin has been assessed by IUCN as a species of
Least Concern (Taylor et al., 2008). While there is not even a rea-
sonable guess at the total numbers of Risso’s dolphins worldwide,
a few estimates exist for speciﬁc areas. Risso’s dolphin numbers off
California were reported to be almost an order of magnitude higher
in winter (32,376, CV = 0.46) than in summer (3980, CV = 0.57;
Forney and Barlow, 1998). Recently, numbers off California, Ore-
gon and Washington were estimated at 11,621 (CV = 0.17; Carretta
et al., 2008). Estimates also exist for the eastern tropical Paciﬁc
(175,800, CV = 0.38; Wade and Gerrodette, 1993), northern Gulf
of Mexico (1589, CV = 0.27; Waring et al., 2009), western North
Atlantic (20,479, CV = 0.59; Waring et al., 2009), waters around
the Hawaiian islands (2372 animals, CV = 0.65; Barlow, 2006), Sri
Lanka (alternative ‘minimum’ point estimates of 5500, assuming
3.1 dolphins/100 nm surveyed, or 13,000, assuming 7.2/100 nm;
Kruse et al., 1991), the eastern Sulu Sea (1514, CV = 0.55; Dolar et al.,
2006) and three areas of concentrated occurrence off Japan (83,300,
CV = 0.17; Miyashita, 1993). More recently, Minamikawa et al.
(2007) estimated 32,864 animals (CV = 0.45) north of 30◦N latitude
and west of 180◦ longitude off Japan. Those authors reported that
although Risso’s dolphins were observed south of 30◦N, such ani-
mals were not included in the abundance estimation because they
could belong to a stock not affected by the Japanese dolphin ﬁshery.
There are several examples of long-term changes in abun-
dance and distribution. For instance, Risso’s dolphins were virtually
absent in the Southern California Bight in the late 1950s (Norris
and Prescott, 1961, did not even mention seeing them in 5 years
during which time they ‘systematically gathered information of
every available kind’ on cetaceans there, while collecting dolphins
and pilot whales for Marineland of the Paciﬁc; they observed 15

other cetacean species ‘in sufﬁcient detail’ to provide individual
accounts) and between 1975 and 1978 they constituted only 3% of
the cetaceans observed in an extensive survey programme there
(Dohl et al., 1980; as cited by Kruse et al., 1999). After an El Ni ˜no
event in 1982–1983, however, daily counts of Risso’s dolphins
increased greatly, especially around Santa Catalina Island where
they came to be considered common (Shane, 1994, 1995b) and
apparently remained so through the 1990s (Kruse et al., 1999).

Little is known about numbers of Risso’s dolphins in the
Mediterranean Sea. The only abundance estimate based on line-
transect methods refers to a 32,270 km2 area east of Spain, where
aerial surveys in 2001–2003 yielded an estimate of 493 (CV = 60.6%;
Gómez de Segura et al., 2006). That estimate was not corrected for
visibility bias and therefore likely underestimates the true abun-
dance in the sampled area (Gómez de Segura et al., 2006). Ship
surveys in the western Mediterranean (Forcada, 1998) as well as
aerial and ship surveys in the Pelagos Sanctuary (Panigada et al.,
2009, 2010) did not result in sufﬁcient numbers of sightings to
make meaningful estimates of abundance for Risso’s dolphins. No
sightings of Risso’s dolphins were made during three ship-based
line-transect surveys in 2002–2003 within an area of 13,200 km2
off northern Sicily (Fortuna et al., 2007). In all Mediterranean
areas with suitable habitat that have been surveyed, encounter
rates for Risso’s dolphins have been low compared with rates for
other more common delphinids; rates have often been an order
of magnitude lower than for striped dolphins, the most abun-
dant species. In the MEDACES and Italian stranding databases, only
a small proportion of total strandings have been of Risso’s dol-
phins: 2.5% of all records in the MEDACES database (N = 7796;
Universitat de Valencia, 2009) and 3.6% of all records or 3.7% of
all animals in the Italian database (N = 3695 records, 3805 animals;
http://mammiferimarini.unipv.it/as of 4 January 2010).

Ecology

Diet

Risso’s dolphins seem to feed predominantly during the night
(Shane, 1995a,b; Praca and Gannier, 2007; Soldevilla et al., 2010),

G. Bearzi et al. / Mammalian Biology 76 (2011) 385–400

389

probably to take advantage of the circadian vertical movements of
their prey (Roper and Young, 1975; Hanlon and Messinger, 1996;
Soldevilla et al., 2010). Diet consists primarily of cephalopods, with
a clear preference for mesopelagic squids (Clarke, 1996; Kruse et al.,
1999). The stomach contents of stranded animals in southeastern
Africa were exclusively cephalopods, Loligo vulgaris reynaudu being
the most important single prey item. Other signiﬁcant contributors
to the diet were Lycoteuthis diadema, Argonauta nodosa, Octopus
magniﬁcus and Ancistrocherius lesueur (Cockcroft et al., 1993). The
lesser octopus Eledone cirrhosa was one of the main prey types
found in Risso’s dolphins stranded in Scotland, Wales and southern
England (Clarke and Pascoe, 1985).

The stomach contents of 13 Risso’s dolphins stranded and
one animal by-caught in eastern Spain between 1987 and 2003
showed a strong preponderance of cephalopods. A total of 25
species belonging to 13 families were found, mostly Argonautidae,
Ommastrephidae, Histioteuthidae and Onychoteuthidae (Blanco et
al., 2006). Despite the numerical importance and high frequency of
the small pelagic octopod Argonauta argo, the greatest nutritional
value would have come from Todarodes sagittatus, Histioteuthis
bonnelli, Histioteuthis reversa, Ancistroteuthis lichtensteini and Illex
coindetii, due to their large size (Blanco et al., 2006). Cephalo-
pod remains from the stomachs of Risso’s dolphins by-caught
or stranded in the central Mediterranean Sea included primarily
the mesopelagic squids Todarodes sagittatus, Ancistroteuthis licht-
ensteini, Histioteuthis bonnelli, Histioteuthis reversa and in lesser
frequency and quantity the argonautid Argonauta argo and the
sepiolid Heteroteuthis dispar as well as a number of other cephalo-
pod species belonging to various families (Table 1). The stomachs
of two Risso’s dolphins taken as bycatch off the Turkish coast
contained exclusively cephalopod remains, predominantly Histio-
teuthis reversa (61%). All other species accounted for less than 10%
of all beaks. Most prey were oceanic cephalopods with wide vertical
distribution and circadian movements (Öztürk et al., 2007). Many
species recorded from the stomach contents are bioluminescent,
and it has been suggested that this may facilitate their detection
by Risso’s dolphins (Bello, 1992; Öztürk et al., 2007). Cycloid ﬁsh
scales as well as bryozoans were found in the stomach of a juvenile
stranded in eastern Spain, while pelagic tunicate species had been
eaten by two adults (Blanco et al., 2006). Blanco et al. (2006) sug-
gested that occurrence of tunicates in the diet of Risso’s dolphins
may be underestimated due to rapid digestion of these watery ani-
mals.

Risso’s dolphins have been observed to forage at night
around ﬁshing boats using illuminated handlines for squid in the
archipelago Pontino Campano. These interactions involved feeding
by groups of 2–5 animals, waiting near ﬁshing boats until the light
had attracted squid (Mussi et al., 1999).

Shane (1995b) hypothesised that the replacement of short-
ﬁnned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus by Risso’s dolphins
around Santa Catalina Island following an El Ni ˜no event repre-
sented competitive displacement related to limited food resources
(see above). A curious feature of Risso’s dolphin distribution in the
Mediterranean region is that these dolphins are rare in the Gibraltar
Strait and adjacent areas, where long-ﬁnned pilot whales Globi-
cephala melas are relatively abundant (De Stephanis et al., 2008).
This might be interpreted as indicative of competitive exclusion.
Niche overlap and competition for prey with Mediterranean odon-
tocetes other than long-ﬁnned pilot whales is considered unlikely
(Blanco et al., 2005).

and areas with steep bottom topography at any distance from
the coast. Upwelling phenomena and mixing of shelf and oceanic
waters in the upper continental slope aggregate zooplankton and
micronekton and create conditions that attract a considerable vari-
ety of the Risso’s dolphin’s cephalopod prey, including squids that
usually inhabit deep oceanic waters (Baumgartner, 1997; Davis et
al., 1998, 2002; Kruse et al., 1999; Yen et al., 2004). Risso’s dolphins
may ‘follow’ oceanic fronts as they move onto or off the shelf and
upper continental slope in order to continue taking advantage of
prey aggregations (Baumgartner, 1997).

In the Mediterranean Sea, similarly to other areas around the
world, Risso’s dolphins prefer steep slopes and submarine canyons
(Ca ˜nadas et al., 2002; Gannier, 2005; Azzellino et al., 2008; Moulins
et al., 2008). Risso’s dolphins across the Mediterranean Sea (N = 60
sightings) were sighted over mean bottom depths of 1280 m, at a
mean distance of 20.4 km (SE = 30.4 km) from the 200-m isobath.
About 32% of sightings occurred within 5 km and over 82% within
30 km of the 200-m isobath (Mangion and Gannier, 2002). Risso’s
dolphins sighted off southern Spain (N = 31) preferred steep areas
with depths greater than 600 m (no sightings in waters shallower
than 400 m), thought to match the habitat of their prey (Ca ˜nadas
et al., 2002). In a study off eastern Spain, distribution was signif-
icantly related to depth (only), but Risso’s dolphins, which were
observed in waters between 500 and 2600 m deep, seemed to pre-
fer waters deeper than 1500 m (Gómez de Segura et al., 2008). Off
Italy, encounter rates were highest in areas 1000 m deep and 14 km
from the coast (Notarbartolo di Sciara et al., 1993). The frequency
of occurrence of Risso’s dolphins in and near the Pelagos Sanctu-
ary was similarly higher near the 1000-m isobath (e.g. Moulins et
al., 2008), but sightings were also made far offshore and in deeper
pelagic waters (Beaubrun et al., 1997; Airoldi et al., 2000; Laran et
al., 2002), suggesting that distribution is not limited to the conti-
nental slope. Praca and Gannier (2007) modelled the distribution
of Risso’s dolphins in the northwestern Mediterranean and found
a strong relationship with steep slope and proximity to the 200 m
contour as well as a certain preference for shallow areas. According
to that study, the main habitat of Risso’s dolphins was restricted
and located on the upper part of the continental slope at a mean
depth of 638 m. Habitats of Risso’s dolphins and long-ﬁnned pilot
whales were well separated (Praca and Gannier, 2007).

In the western Ligurian Sea where the continental shelf is par-
ticularly narrow, Risso’s dolphins were distributed along steep
sections of the upper continental slope, a few km from the coast, at
depths ranging between 374 and 1100 m (mean 822 m; Azzellino et
al., 2008). Their occurrence in this area during the summer months
did not change across years or months but encounter rates were
higher during certain shorter intervals, suggesting some sort of
‘transient’ use of the study area. This may indicate a strategy to
exploit the temporary availability of food resources induced by zoo-
plankton accumulation (Azzellino et al., 2008). A correlation was
also found between Risso’s dolphin presence and stormy sea con-
ditions in the preceding days (Azzellino et al., 2008). Those authors
speculated that moving along the slope area would be an efﬁcient
strategy to exploit prey attracted by the wind-driven accumulation
of zooplankton (Azzellino et al., 2008).

Preliminary photo-identiﬁcation data suggest relatively wide
movements but do not preclude some degree of ﬁdelity or regular
use of speciﬁc areas (Ca ˜nadas and Sagarminaga, 1997; David and
Di Méglio, 1999; Casacci and Gannier, 2000; Mussi and Miragliuolo,
2003; Airoldi et al., 2005; Mariani et al., 2010).

Habitat and movements

Group size and social structure

Risso’s dolphins inhabit continental slope and deep oceanic
waters, being most common in steep upper sections of the conti-
nental slope as well as around subsurface seamounts, escarpments

Risso’s dolphin groups tend to be small to moderate in size (up
to around 100 individuals), averaging perhaps 30 animals (Kruse et
al., 1999). Groups of up to 4000 have been reported off California

(Dohl et al., 1983 as cited by Kruse et al., 1999). Large aggregations
are thought to form in response to abundant and concentrated food
resources. Groups (N = 595) off Pico Island in the Azores included
between 1 and 61 individuals, with a median of 13 (Hartman et al.,
2009). Group ﬂuidity is high, with small subgroups displaying the

highest degree of group ﬁdelity (Kruse et al., 1999). Few studies
have focussed on the social structure of Risso’s dolphins. Off Pico
island, Azores, individuals were found to have long-term bonds
and they occurred in pairs or stable clusters of 3–12 individuals,
with strong associations between adult males and between adult

females (Hartman et al., 2008). Risso’s dolphins in the Ligurian Sea
were characterised by low levels of relatedness based on genetic
analyses performed on samples of skin tissue, and kin-based afﬁl-
iations were found only within groups of females. While females
within groups tended to associate with related females, and females
outside the groups were not related to each other, males within
groups were less related than expected by chance (Gaspari, 2004).
Group sizes of Risso’s dolphins observed in parts of the Mediter-
ranean Sea are summarised in Table 2. As the deﬁnition of ‘group’
can vary among studies and sampling methods are often undeﬁned,
the reported group sizes (and those reported in a number of other
unpublished contributions) represent relative values that cannot
be directly compared.

Globally Risso’s dolphins have been observed in mixed
groups with a number of species, including the Dall’s porpoise
Phocoenoides dalli, Paciﬁc white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus
obliquidens, dusky dolphin Lagenorhynchus obscurus, northern right
whale dolphin Lissodelphis borealis, bottlenose dolphin Tursiops sp.,
common dolphins Delphinus sp., dolphins in the genus Stenella,
pilot whales Globicephala sp., pygmy killer whale Feresa attenuata
and false killer whale Pseudorca crassidens (Würsig and Würsig,
1980; Baird and Stacey, 1991; Kruse et al., 1999; Hartman et
al., 2008; Pereira, 2008). Interactions also have been observed
with gray whales Eschrichtius robustus (Shelden et al., 1995), ﬁn
whales Balaenoptera physalus and sperm whales Physeter macro-
cephalus (Kruse et al., 1999; Hartman et al., 2008; Pereira, 2008).
Associations with other cetacean species are uncommon in the
Mediterranean Sea. In the Gulf of Corinth, Risso’s dolphins (2
individuals separately) were observed in mixed groups with
striped dolphins and short-beaked common dolphins (Frantzis and
Herzing, 2002). In the waters off the island of Ischia, Italy, Risso’s
dolphins were occasionally seen in association with striped dol-
phins and sperm whales (Mariani et al., 2010). In Turkish waters 2
individuals were observed in a group of striped dolphins (Dede et
al., 2009).

Predation

There is little information on the predation risks faced by Risso’s
dolphins around the world. Large sharks (e.g. the white shark Car-
charodon carcharias; Heithaus, 2001) and killer whales are both
likely predators based, for example, on observations of wounded
animals (especially calves; Hartman et al., 2008). In the Mediter-
ranean Sea predation is considered a minor cause of mortality for
small cetaceans generally (Aguilar, 2000; Bearzi et al., 2003, 2008)
and it is unlikely to be signiﬁcant for Risso’s dolphins. Numbers
of large sharks have declined drastically in Mediterranean waters
over the past century (Ferretti et al., 2008) and this must have
considerably reduced predation pressure. Other potential dolphin
predators, such as killer whales and false killer whales, are rare in
the region (Notarbartolo di Sciara, 1987; Reeves and Notarbartolo
di Sciara, 2006) and therefore unlikely to cause signiﬁcant mor-
tality. An attack by common bottlenose dolphins resulted in the

death of a juvenile Risso’s dolphin in U.K. coastal waters (Barnett
et al., 2009), but similar cases have not been reported in the
Mediterranean.

Parasites and epizootics

At least a few of the many parasites known to infect Risso’s
dolphins and other Mediterranean cetaceans (Dhermain et al.,
2002) can have serious health effects. For example, a Risso’s dol-
phin and its fetus stranded alive on the Spanish Mediterranean
coast with what was diagnosed as a fatal toxoplasmosis infec-
tion (Resendes et al., 2002). Infections with the protozoan agent
Toxoplasma gondii are common in the western Mediterranean and
especially prevalent in coastal areas, but only animals with com-
promised immune systems are at risk of becoming seriously ill
(Domingo et al., 2000; Resendes et al., 2002; Cabezon et al., 2004).
Among the other parasites documented in Mediterranean Risso’s
dolphins are Crassicauda grampicola and Pennella sp. (found in
or on a few animals dead- and live-stranded in Spain and Italy;
Cornaglia et al., 2000; Domingo et al., 2000; Resendes et al., 2002;
Zucca et al., 2004, 2005; Marcer et al., 2008). Also, Fernández
et al. (2003) reported 5 species of gastrointestinal helminths
found in 17 Risso’s dolphins stranded in the western Mediter-
ranean.

Recent viral epizootics in the Mediterranean Sea have affected
populations of several dolphin species, particularly striped dol-
phins (Van Bressem et al., 1991; Aguilar and Raga, 1993; Raga et
al., 2008) but also common bottlenose dolphins (Tsur et al., 1997;
Van de Bildt et al., 2001) and long-ﬁnned pilot whales Globicephala
melas (Fernández et al., 2008). While morbillivirus infections were
conﬁrmed in Risso’s dolphins from the western Atlantic (Duignan
et al., 1995), there is no evidence that viral outbreaks have affected
these dolphins in the Mediterranean.

Mass strandings of Risso’s dolphins are rare (Baird, 2009). Of
the many strandings in the Mediterranean Sea, we found only one
report of a live-stranding involving more than 2 animals. There was
a stranding of 5 animals in eastern Spain in 1994 (Alegre et al.,
1996). The dolphins were immediately returned to the open sea,
but 24 h later 4 of them stranded again in the same area (1 adult,
2 subadults and 1 juvenile, all females). The adult was treated for
large wounds on both sides of the body and an acute respiratory
problem but died within 4 h. The other 3, reportedly also in poor
condition, were returned to sea and disappeared.

Stranding

Threats

A variety of human activities threaten cetaceans and many of
those activities are expected to increase in the foreseeable future
(Reynolds et al., 2009). Below, we identify and describe the threats

392

likely to affect Risso’s dolphins, particularly in the Mediterranean
Sea, with the aim of informing management and guiding research
effort.

the animal had been attempting to remove bait, whole mackerel
Scomber scombrus, from the line. The dolphin was taken on board
and released alive 34 h later.

Incidental mortality

Incidental mortality (or bycatch) of Risso’s dolphins in ﬁshing
gear has been reported in many areas. For example, in US waters
including the Paciﬁc, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico EEZs, relatively
small numbers get entangled in pelagic drift gillnets, pelagic long-
lines, purse seines and pelagic pair trawls (Carretta et al., 2008;
Waring et al., 2009). Nearly all of the animals taken in gillnets die,
but frequently the longline-caught animals are released alive with
wounds ranging from minor to severe. The Risso’s dolphin is one
of the primary cetacean species (along with pilot whales Globi-
cephala spp.) that interact with the U.S. East Coast pelagic longline
ﬁshery (Garrison, 2007). Of 64 Risso’s dolphins reported as cap-
tured (either mouth-hooked or entangled in line) between 1992
and 2004, 30 were seriously injured and 4 were observed dead.
Risso’s dolphin interactions were correlated with geographic loca-
tion, proximity to the shelf break, the length of the main line and the
bait type. Risso’s dolphins were attracted to squid bait as a ready
food source but they could also depredate the catch. The use of
ﬁsh bait signiﬁcantly decreased the frequency of Risso’s dolphin
by-catch (Garrison, 2007). Off eastern Taiwan large numbers of
dolphins, often including Risso’s dolphins, are taken in large-mesh
drift gillnets for large pelagic ﬁsh (Perrin et al., 2005). In Sri Lanka,
the Philippines and Ghana, Risso’s dolphins are often taken in drift
gillnets and sold openly in ﬁsh markets (Leatherwood and Reeves,
1989; Kruse et al., 1991; Dolar, 1994; Van Waerebeek et al., 2009).
In these and some other areas, the distinction between bycatch
(accidental) and directed catch (intentional) is blurred because of
the market value of cetacean products for human consumption and
shark bait.

In the Mediterranean, most bycatch of Risso’s dolphins is by
pelagic gillnets (also called driftnets). These are large, ﬂoating nets
that target primarily swordﬁsh Xiphias gladius and tunas Thunnus
spp. Driftnets can be up to 50 km long and hang vertically 20–30 m
from the surface. Because these nets indiscriminately kill protected
species such as whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles, rays and sea birds
(Notarbartolo di Sciara, 1990; Di Natale and Notarbartolo di Sciara,
1994; IWC, 1994), they have been banned in the European Union
(EU) since 2002. The ongoing illegal use of driftnets in several parts
of the Mediterranean (Pace et al., 2008; Cornax and Pardo, 2009),
including areas where Risso’s dolphins occur, means that inciden-
tal mortality almost certainly continues at some scale. For instance,
mortality of Risso’s dolphins in driftnets was reported from the
Turkish side of the Aegean Sea based on direct observations from
boats (Öztürk et al., 2001). Risso’s dolphin mortality in driftnets
deployed by the Italian ﬂeet was signiﬁcant and probably unsus-
tainable in the early 1990s (Di Natale, 1995) and it likely remains
high although there have been no focussed investigations in recent
years. Of 100 Risso’s dolphins stranded or rescued along the coasts
of Italy between 1986 and 2005, 14 were reported to have signs of
bycatch. Of these, 4 bore hooks somewhere on the body or were
entangled in longline, 2 were entangled in gillnetting, 1 was entan-
gled in a set net of some kind (trammel or gillnet), 2 had unspeciﬁed
‘ﬁshing gear’ on the body and 5 had ﬁn amputations (N = 4) or knife
cuts (N = 1) (Centro Studi Cetacei, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992,
1994, 1995, 1996a,b, 1997a,b, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004;
Centro Studi Cetacei Onlus e Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di
Milano, 2004, 2006a,b). One Risso’s dolphin that stranded alive in
Italy was released after a large ﬁshing hook had been removed
from its upper jaw (Zucca et al., 2005). Cataldini and Bello (1987)
described an incident in which a Risso’s dolphin became hooked on
a drifting longline set for swordﬁsh off southern Italy. Presumably,

Mortality of cetaceans, including Risso’s dolphins, also occurs in
the Spanish surface longline ﬁshery in the western Mediterranean,
which targets swordﬁsh, blueﬁn tuna T. thynnus and albacore
T. alalunga (Cami ˜nas and Valeiras, 2001). Hooks are baited with
ﬁsh (e.g. mackerel, sardine, scabbard ﬁsh) and shortﬁn squid Illex
spp. (Valeiras and Cami ˜nas, 2003). A study conducted in 1999
and 2000, encompassing 798 ﬁshing operations with onboard
observers, reported bycatch of striped dolphins (N = 7) and Risso’s
dolphins (N = 7; 5 in swordﬁsh and 2 in blueﬁn tuna gear) (Cami ˜nas
and Valeiras, 2001). Most animals reportedly were released alive
(Valeiras and Cami ˜nas, 2002).

Three of 8 animals stranded in Croatia between 2000 and 2002
reportedly had been by-caught in ﬁshing nets (presumably gillnets;
Gomerˇci ´c et al., 2006). There are a few reports of bycatch of Risso’s
dolphins in bottom-set gillnets and trammel nets deployed in
France and Italy (e.g. Duguy et al., 1983; Di Natale and Notarbartolo
di Sciara, 1994).

Stranding data under-represent the true scale of ﬁshery-related
mortality and serious injury because (i) not all animals that die or
are seriously injured wash ashore, (ii) not all of those that do wash
ashore show signs of entanglement or other ﬁshery interaction
and (iii) not all dolphins that wash ashore are detected, investi-
gated and reported. Moreover, the level of experience and technical
expertise of investigators involved in stranding networks varies
widely and the ability to recognize and diagnose the signs of ﬁshery
interactions (e.g. scars, wounds, disﬁgurements) is an acquired skill
(Read and Murray, 2000). Considering that methods to investigate
and assess incidental mortality of small cetaceans—through either
onboard observation or studies of strandings—are now fairly well
developed (e.g. Lien et al., 1994; Northridge, 1996; NMFS, 2004;
Northridge and Fortuna, 2008), speciﬁc protocols should be imple-
mented within the Mediterranean to improve understanding and
mitigate mortality of Risso’s dolphins and other small cetaceans.
One caveat is that assessment of bycatches of protected species
by vessels operating illegally, as is the case with those that deploy
pelagic drift gillnets across most of the basin, is a particular chal-
lenge.

Intentional takes

As mentioned earlier, much of the ‘bycatch’ of Risso’s and other
dolphins in ﬁshing gear in places like Sri Lanka, the Philippines and
Ghana is intentional: the animals are landed and used for human
consumption or as shark bait in several areas around the world
(Leatherwood and Reeves, 1989; Kruse et al., 1991; Dolar, 1994;
Dizon et al., 2000; Baker et al., 2006; Van Waerebeek et al., 2009).
Also, they are hunted in some of those countries with harpoons and
other weapons. In US Paciﬁc and Atlantic waters, there is evidence
of occasional shooting of Risso’s dolphins, apparently by ﬁshermen
who view them as harmful to ﬁsheries (Carretta et al., 2008; Waring
et al., 2009).

There is no evidence that intentional killing of Risso’s dolphins
has ever occurred on a major scale in Mediterranean waters, though
some may have died during the extermination campaigns con-
ducted until the ﬁrst half of the 20th century and directed primarily
at common bottlenose dolphins and short-beaked common dol-
phins (Bearzi et al., 2004). Of the 100 Risso’s dolphins stranded or
rescued along the coasts of Italy between 1986 and 2005, 2 were
reported to have bullet wounds and had likely been shot (Centro
Studi Cetacei, 1988, 1992).

Small numbers of Risso’s dolphins taken in drive hunts in Japan
have been brought into captivity and on a few occasions live-
stranded individuals have been rehabilitated and kept in aquaria

G. Bearzi et al. / Mammalian Biology 76 (2011) 385–400

393

in the United States (Kruse et al., 1999). There have also been a few
cases in the Mediterranean region of attempts to rehabilitate ani-
mals that had live-stranded or were otherwise in difﬁculty (Alegre
et al., 1996; Alonso et al., 1999; Stanzani et al., 2006; Marcer et al.,
2008).

Noise and direct disturbance

There is growing evidence that prolonged direct (or physi-
cal) disturbance and noise caused by boat trafﬁc can affect the
behaviour and habitat use of cetaceans (Nowacek et al., 2007). In the
Mediterranean Sea there has been a great expansion of recreational
boat trafﬁc and shipping in recent decades (Dobler, 2002), but the
possibility that this has led to disruption of behaviour or excluded
Risso’s dolphins from important habitat has not been investigated.
Several studies elsewhere have shown that vessel trafﬁc can affect
dolphin behaviour, activity and energy budgets, habitat use and
reproductive success (e.g. Lusseau, 2003, 2004; Bejder et al., 2006).
This can include short-term displacement, long-term area avoid-
ance and reduced female reproductive success. Risso’s dolphins
may be affected in these ways when they move into coastal waters
or when their usual habitat occurs in or near areas of high vessel
trafﬁc. For instance, a preliminary study off Pico, Azores, suggested
that the resting behaviour of Risso’s dolphins was disrupted by
whale watching boats (Visser et al., 2006; Oudejans et al., 2007).

An instance of severe harassment of a group of Risso’s dolphins
occurred off the island of Ischia in Italy in August 2000 when plea-
sure boats approached approximately 20 animals sighted 1–2 km
from shore (Bearzi, 2003; Miragliuolo et al., 2004). As the number of
boats increased, Harbour Master’s ofﬁcers and dolphin researchers
intervened to protect the animals. By the time the authorities
arrived, the dolphins had been surrounded by perhaps 100 speed-
boats and herded into a resort harbour where some 400 boats were
anchored. The dolphins ended up in water less than 3 m deep.
Dozens of boats headed towards them at high speed every time
they surfaced. The dolphins changed course and speed abruptly as
the boaters tried to photograph and ‘play’ with them. They showed
clear signs of distress and swam erratically at high speed, some-
times colliding with one another. One of at least 3 calves in the
group was seen spinning and swimming in circles apart from the
others. Through a 2-h effort, the ofﬁcers and researchers managed
to clear the immediate area around the dolphins of pleasure boats
and the animals moved offshore in a single, tight group (Bearzi,
2003; Miragliuolo et al., 2004). Such an event shows that boat dis-
turbance and unregulated dolphin watching, in the absence of good
public awareness and education, can be a signiﬁcant threat.

Noise from human activities including seismic surveys, marine
construction and the use of military or other sonars is a cause for
concern for Risso’s dolphins and other cetaceans (Richardson et al.,
1995; Nowacek et al., 2007). However, so far no deaths of Risso’s
dolphins have been linked deﬁnitively to noise. Jepson et al. (2005)
found evidence of in vivo gas bubble formation and gas embolism
associated with acute and chronic tissue injury in several cetacean
species, including Risso’s dolphins, and suggested further investiga-
tion of its relationship with exposure to anthropogenic sound (also
see Fernández et al., 2005). In this regard, Wang and Yang (2006)
reported 2 live-strandings of single Risso’s dolphins in Taiwan.
Noting that such events are ‘fairly common’ there, those authors
concluded that these 2 strandings probably were not related to
noise but that other strandings during the same time period and
involving other species probably were.

Prey depletion

In the Mediterranean Sea, prey depletion caused by overﬁshing
is regarded as a threat to short-beaked common dolphins (Bearzi

et al., 2003) and common bottlenose dolphins (Bearzi et al., 2008),
whose diets include some species that are also targeted by ﬁsheries.
As a predominantly teuthophagous species that feeds in continen-
tal slope waters, the Risso’s dolphin may be less vulnerable to this
threat since most ﬁshing occurs in continental shelf waters and tar-
gets bony ﬁshes. Few of the main cephalopod prey species of Risso’s
dolphins are commercially important. Two factors, however, are of
concern: (1) the possible expansion of Mediterranean deep-water
ﬁsheries (e.g. Politou et al., 2003), as observed elsewhere (Morato et
al., 2006), and (2) the tendency of ﬁsheries to target species lower
and lower in the food web as populations of higher trophic level
species are depleted (Pauly et al., 1998; Sala et al., 2004; Pauly and
Palomares, 2005). These trends could lead to reductions in prey
populations or otherwise disrupt food webs in continental slope
waters where Risso’s dolphins forage.

Xenobiotic contamination

Toxic contamination can affect reproduction and health at the
individual and population level (O’Hara and O’Shea, 2001; Fossi
and Marsili, 2003; Newman and Smith, 2006). There is evidence
to suggest a causal link between organochlorine exposure and
reproductive, endocrine and immunological disorders in cetaceans
(Aguilar and Borrell, 1994; Lahvis et al., 1995; Jepson et al., 1999;
Schwacke et al., 2002; Hall et al., 2006). Levels of organochlo-
rine compounds in Risso’s dolphins from the Mediterranean Sea
have been described as ‘high’ (Corsolini et al., 1995; Marsili and
Focardi, 1997; Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 2000), as have levels of
trace metals (Storelli et al., 1999; Frodello et al., 2000; Frodello
and Marchand, 2001; Shoham-Frider et al., 2002; Capelli et al.,
2008). It is uncertain, however, whether recent and current lev-
els of exposure to any of these contaminants are affecting Risso’s
dolphins in the region. Cephalophods in the stomach of one Risso’s
dolphin stranded in Corsica had mercury concentrations about 25
times higher than those of ﬁsh found in the stomachs of other
delphinid species in the same sample, and 50 times higher than
concentrations recommended for human consumption (Frodello et
al., 2000).

Ingestion of debris

Plastic debris has become widespread in the marine environ-
ment (Wolfe, 1987; Laist et al., 1999; Derraik, 2002). The problem
is particularly acute in the Mediterranean Sea, where much of the
coastline is heavily developed and the human presence is nearly
ubiquitous. Plastic accumulates in Risso’s dolphin habitat in con-
centrations that vary depending on meteorological forcing, marine
currents and debris input levels (Aliani et al., 2003). Obstruction of
the digestive tract by ingested plastic is a known cause of cetacean
mortality (Walker and Coe, 1990; Tarpley and Marwitz, 1993). The
causes of plastic ingestion by cetaceans probably vary. In some
instances it may be related to debilitation or starvation, in oth-
ers simply a consequence of investigating inappropriate prey items
(Kastelein and Lavaleije, 1992; Pribanic et al., 1999; Baird and
Hooker, 2000; Poncelet et al., 2000). The chances of the latter may
be higher for prematurely weaned calves (Baird and Hooker, 2000).
Although it is not unusual to ﬁnd plastic and other debris in the
stomachs of Risso’s dolphins (Laist, 1997; González et al., 2000;
Shoham-Frider et al., 2002), it is unclear whether this constitutes a
serious threat to populations. Of the 100 Risso’s dolphins stranded
or rescued along the coasts of Italy between 1986 and 2005, one
reportedly had many plastic bags and a ping-pong ball in its stom-
ach, and the stomach and esophagus of another were occluded by
plastic bags (Centro Studi Cetacei, 1988, 1991). Of the 59 Risso’s dol-
phins stranded in France between 1972 and 2003 (including along
the Atlantic coast), 2 had ingested plastic bags (Dhermain, 2004).

394

Those proportions do not reﬂect actual rates of ingestion because
only a minority of the stranded animals were dissected.

Climate change

Some of the effects of global warming have become dramat-
ically apparent in recent years (Pollack et al., 1998; Barnett et al.,
2001; IPCC, 2007). Climate change has the potential to affect a range
of biological processes and cause signiﬁcant shifts in marine and
other biota (e.g. Pe ˜nuelas et al., 2002; Parmesan and Yohe, 2003;
Parmesan, 2006; Díaz-Almela et al., 2007). Increased temperature
has been observed in Mediterranean deep (Bethoux et al., 1990) and

surface waters (Metaxas et al., 1991; Bethoux and Gentili, 1996)
and there is increasing evidence of biological responses to such
warming (Francour et al., 1994; Díaz-Almela et al., 2007; Philippart,
2007), including disease outbreaks, faunal shifts and spreading of
invasive species (Lejeusne et al., 2009).

The effects of climate change on cetaceans, often mediated
via changes in prey abundance and distribution, may include
shifts in distribution and grouping behaviour (Lusseau et al.,
2004; Learmonth et al., 2006; MacLeod, 2009; Simmonds and
Eliott, 2009). Deep-water oceanic communities may reorganise
in response to ocean warming, with low-latitude losses of diver-
sity and resilience (Whitehead et al., 2008). Climate-driven effects

on Mediterranean ecosystems are likely already occurring (e.g.
Gambaiani et al., 2009), but it is uncertain how they might apply to
Risso’s dolphins. Ocean acidiﬁcation is also likely to affect marine
biodiversity in ways that are poorly understood and difﬁcult to
predict for cetaceans (Orr et al., 2005; Whitehead et al., 2008).

The example mentioned earlier involving the replacement of
short-ﬁnned pilot whales by Risso’s dolphins in an area off southern
California, coincident with an El Ni ˜no event (Shane, 1994, 1995b),
may be relevant and instructive. In another instance, changes in
species composition and encounter rates of several small odonto-
cetes were observed in Monterey Bay, California, correlated with
the El Ni ˜no 1997–1998 and La Ni ˜na 1999 events. As sea surface
temperatures increased in August 1997, species that previously
had been virtually absent became conspicuous, including Risso’s
dolphins (Benson et al., 2002). Such ﬂuctuations in community
structure and species composition, likely driven by background
climate variability, tend to confound efforts to characterise and
quantify the effects on cetaceans and other marine organisms of
climate change and processes such as acidiﬁcation.

Conclusions

The activities and processes that may have negative effects
on Risso’s dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea, and their rela-
tive signiﬁcance based on present knowledge, are summarised in
Table 3. When the quality of information is indicated as ‘poor’, this
means focussed investigations are needed. Research should also
be designed to clarify the underlying dynamics of threats judged
to have ‘high’ or ‘likely-high’ impacts at the population level, in
the expectation that appropriate mitigation measures can then
be identiﬁed and implemented. Data on abundance, distribution,
movements, population dynamics and trends as well as better
information on threats (e.g. bycatch in ﬁshing gear) are needed
to inform conservation efforts and ensure that Risso’s dolphins
remain a functioning part of marine ecosystems in the Mediter-
ranean region. At every stage, it is important to ensure that the
results of research and monitoring are made available to the sci-
entiﬁc and conservation communities, preferably in the form of
integrated analyses published in the peer-reviewed literature.

Numerous national Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of many
different types, sizes and purposes have been designated in
Mediterranean riparian States, but speciﬁc measures for cetacean
conservation are rarely included in the management plans for such
areas. In addition, most MPAs are coastal and do not encompass
habitat that would be consistently suitable for Risso’s dolphins. A
notable exception is the 87,000 km2 cetacean sanctuary created in
1999 by France, Italy and the Monaco Principality in the Corso-
Ligurian-Provenc¸ al Basin (the ‘Pelagos Sanctuary’; Notarbartolo di
Sciara et al., 2008a,b) which is, however, still far from effective as a
tool for cetacean conservation (Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2009).

Inclusion of Risso’s dolphin habitat in networks of offshore pro-
tected areas would be one way of addressing threats to this species
in the mid- to long-term. Indeed, various MPAs have been proposed
to protect the habitat of deep-water cetacean species (including
Risso’s dolphin) in Spanish Mediterranean waters (Ca ˜nadas et al.,
2005; Gómez de Segura et al., 2008) and there are prospects for
Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs)
in areas beyond national jurisdiction (e.g. Notarbartolo di Sciara
and Agardy, 2009). If effectively managed, deep-water or offshore
protected areas could have long-term conservation beneﬁts for
Risso’s dolphins. Pending the implementation of such area-based
management strategies, any actions taken to mitigate immediate
and well-known threats to cetaceans and other large marine ver-
tebrates in the Mediterranean region, particularly entanglement in
pelagic gillnets (driftnets), are bound to beneﬁt Risso’s dolphins.
Considering that driftnetting is already illegal in EU waters, what

is most needed is strict enforcement of that ban and its extension
to the high seas and to waters under non-EU State jurisdiction.
