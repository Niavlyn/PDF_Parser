First of all, I would like to thank the numerous people who have helped me in so many 

different ways all along this journey because each of them has contributed in his or her own 

way to this work. 

I would not  have even heard about  this  PhD without  the person who has sent  me the 

vacancy  because  she  remembered  that  I  was  looking  for  a  thesis  with  marine  mammal 

bioacoustics. Merci beaucoup à Lauriane Rat-Fischer pour ta pensée à moi au bon moment ! 

I am very grateful to my PhD supervisor and the director of the EthoS lab for accepting 

me  as  their  student.  Merci  beaucoup  à  Alban  Lemasson  et  à  Martine  Hausberger  pour 

m’avoir  donné  l’occasion  d’apprendre  tout  ce  que  j’ai  appris  avec  vous  et  votre  soutien 

pendant les trois ans en tout au long de cette thèse ! 

Further  I  am  thankful  to  the  members  of  my  PhD  committee.  Merci  à  Christophe 

Guinet  pour  avoir  accepté  d’être  rapporteur  et  d’évaluer  cette  thèse.  Vorrei  anche 

ringraziare Patrizia D’Ettorre che legga la tesi e commentato. Thank you very much to Stan 

Kuczaj for being examiner of this thesis. Egalement je tiens à remercie Claude Baudoin pour 

avoir accepté d’être examinateur de cette thèse. 

The  work  presented  here  is  of  course  a  result  of  collaboration.  First  with  Planète 

Sauvage, the zoo who housed the dolphins, but also with other researchers and I am grateful 

for  all  the  help  and  the  cooperation,  the  valuable  discussion  and  ideas.  Merci  beaucoup  à 

Philippe  Vignaud  et  à  Martin  Böye  pour  m’avoir  accueilli  à  Planète  Sauvage.  Merci 

beaucoup  à  Marie  Trabalon  pour  nos  séances  dans  ton  laboratoire!  Merci  beaucoup  à 

Benoist  Schaal,  Aurélie  Célérier  et  Silvia  Campagna  pour  tous  les  discussions  très 

intéressants et secourables.  

I  had  the  good  fortune  to  arrive  in  a  lab,  which  welcomed  me  warmly,  despite  the 

initial  language  difficulties.  Merci  beaucoup  à  tout  le  labo  EthoS  pour  avoir  accueilli  une 

jeune allemande qui n’a pas parlé un mot français ! Merci à Françoise Joubaud pour avoir 

trouvé  des  livres  et  articles,  même  les  vieux,  et  pour  le  pull.  Merci  à  Jean-Pierre  Caudal

pour  m’avoir  appris  quelques  mots  breton  et  l’explication  du  triton.  Merci  à  Véronique 

Guyot-Biquand  et  Caroline  Coste  pour  leur  aide  avec  le  matériel,  de  l’ordinateur  aux 

caméscopes. Et bien sûr merci aux « jeunes rennais », anciens et courants : Carole Fureix, 

Agathe Laurence, Océane Lebot, Audrey Perret et Florent Pittet. 

Behind all this research a huge amount of administration work is necessary and there 

are several people who worked and work at different instances in the course of this thesis and 

helped me a lot. Merci aux secrétaires du labo EthoS : Sylvie Dufresne et Isabelle Simier, et 

également  à  Michèle  Le  Guennec  et  Antoine  Lazou !  Que  ferions-nous  sans  vous et  votre 

organisation  de  notre  chaos  administratif ?!  Je  tiens  à  remercie  aussi  Badia  Mssassi  de 

l’école  doctorale  VAS  qui  a  toujours  répondu  à  toutes  les  questions  avec  gentillesse  et 

serviabilité.  Et  aussi  à  Planète  Sauvage  il  y  a  des  bonnes  âmes  qui  m’ont  toujours  aidé : 

merci à Catherine Bosch, Jessie Bouron et Emilie Durand.  

Just as in Rennes, I was also warmly welcomed at the Station Biologique de Paimpont. 

This station is like a small, remote village behind the mountain in the middle of the infinite-

wide Forêt Brocéliande. Going there in the morning was often like travelling into a fairy tale 

and I am not sure if I have maybe seen wizard Merlin or King Arthur one or the other times. 

For  sure  I  have  heard  the  roaring  of  stags.  Working  in  the  station  was  always  a  pleasure, 

above  all  because  of  the  people  sharing  this  place  with  you.  Merci  à  Daniel  Cluezau, 

Fabienne Perron et Catherine Racineux pour m’avoir accueilli à la station. Au nom de toutes 

les fées de la cuisine, je tiens remercie Maryvonne Lefeuvre, Catherine Lebouvier et Soizic 

Joly  d'avoir  pris  notre  bien-être  culinaire.  Merci  également  aux  « gens  de  l'étage 

supérieur » :  Charlène  Briard,  Antoine  Dewisme,  Thomas  Foucart,  Alexia  Garnier,  Céline

Dominique Vallet. Merci à Hervé Amat pour gérer le matériel d'écriture. 

  

 

 

I remember the day when I first entered the PhD student bureau: four girls. But if you 

believe that four or even five girls are too much for one room, then you’re wrong. I had the 

good  fortune  to  had  very  taking  colleagues  who  welcomed  be  warmly  and  helped  me  so 

much.  Merci  beaucoup  aux  «  anciennes »,  Agnès  Candiotti,  Audrey  Maille,  Clémence

From  the  forest,  I  arrived  in  the  Cité  Marine,  my  second  work  place.  Having  an 

underwater  bureau  is  really  extraordinary  –  especially  when  dolphins  are  looking  through 

your  window.  But  above  all  I  am  very  grateful  to  my  colleagues.  Leti,  merci  que  tu  m’as 

accueilli dans ton équipe. J’ai appris beaucoup avec toi et je te remercie pour ton ouverture

1.  THE UMWELT CONCEPT OF JAKOB VON UEXKÜLL 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

In  1909,  Jakob  von  Uexküll  established  a  new  concept  and  with  it  a  new 

perspective  on  living  creatures’  perception  of  their  environment:  Umwelt  (translation 

from  German  to  English:  environment;  von  Uexküll  1909),  meaning  subjective 

universe (Chien 2006). Von Uexküll (1934) conceded animals as subjects and rejected 

considering them as machines driven solely by reflexes. This opinion was common in 
the  early  20th  century,  as  for  example  outlined  in  James  (1962).  In  contrast  to  the 

contemporary  common  opinion  (e.g.  in  the  theory  of  behaviourism),  von  Uexküll 

(1934)  assumed  internal,  cognitive  processes  as  equally  important  as  the  observable 

behaviour of an animal and admitted its internal states and motivation. 

The subject’s Umwelt is divided into two parts, the Merkwelt and the  Wirkwelt, 

both forming a coherent entity (von Uexküll 1909). Merkwelt (engl. perceptual world) 

refers  to  everything  a  subject  perceives.  Wirkwelt  (engl.  active  world)  refers  to 

everything  a  subject  does.  To  be  perceived  by  a  subject,  objects  have  to  possess  a 

feature (Merkmal) that matches a subject’s receptor (von Uexküll 1909). The perceived 

stimulus is then processed in the Merkorgan (engl. sense organ), for example the brain, 

where a meaning is attributed to each stimulus. This meaning can change depending on 

the context or the subject’s internal state. Thus, a stimulus can have different meanings 

to the subject. According to the meaning, the subject’s Wirkorgan (engl. act organ) will 

take an action (Wirkmal) on or with the object. This closed loop between subject and 

object is called Funktionskreis (engl. functional circle; von Uexküll 1934). 

Because of the  crucial role of receptors that enable the perception of  Merkmale 

and  the  sensory  processing  structures  (Merkorgan),  the  Umwelt  is  determined  by  the 

species’ bauplan. Thus, although several species can share the same environment, each 

has  its  own  Umwelt  as  it  differs  from  another  species  regarding  its  sensory  abilities. 

Furthermore,  even  within  the  same  species  individuals  do  not  necessarily  share  the 

same Umwelt because of morphoanatomical differences, caused for example by genetic 

defects or events during ontogeny (e.g. a blind and a seeing person may share the same 

environment  but  not  the  same  Umwelt).  Therefore,  each  individual  has  its  own,  self-

centred Umwelt that is determined by the individual’s bauplan (von Uexküll 1934).

Chapter 1: Introduction 

Although von Uexküll (1909) admits that species differ in their perception-based 

experience,  he  insists  on  their  equality  regarding  their  adaption.  According  to  him 

“each  animal  subject,  the  simple  and  the  complex,  are  equally  adapted  to  their 

environment; a simple animal has a simple Umwelt, a complex animal a complex one”, 

thus no species can be considered superior to another (von Uexküll 1934). 

 

2.  COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT UMWELTEN 

It  is  difficult  to  determine  a  species’  Umwelt  from  an  external  point  of  view 

because  we,  as  humans,  also  possess  our  own  Umwelt.  By  simply  transferring  our 

perception of reality to another species, we do not respect its specific subjectivity. An 

object that might be meaningful from the human point of view can be meaningless to 

another  species  (Delfour  2010)  either  because  it  does  not  possess  the  according 

receptors  to  perceive  the  object’s  feature  or  because  the  object,  although  it  can  be 

perceived, does not have a meaning for this species. Therefore, an unbiased study of a 

species’ sensory perception and behaviour is necessary. 

Because  the  perceptual  mechanisms  tend  to  be  conservative  in  evolution, 

information  from  related  species  can  be  valuable  (Saslow  2002).  Phylogeny  (i.e. 

genetic relatedness) as well as ecological constraints are involved in the evolution of 

a species’ Umwelt. It is unclear whether one has more weight than the other.  

This dilemma is particularly true for species such as cetaceans that performed a 

drastic change in lifestyle in the course of evolution. This mammalian order returned 

from  a  terrestrial  life  back  into  the  water,  which  caused  extensive  changes  in 

anatomy,  physiology,  and  behaviour  (Gatesy  et  al.  2013).  The  results  of  this 

remarkable transformation are extant cetaceans that include baleen whales (Mysticeti) 

and  toothed  whales  (Odontoceti).  Their  closest  relatives  on  land  are  artiodactyls 

(even-toed  ungulates)  including  deer,  antelopes,  gazelles,  cattle,  sheep,  goats, 

giraffes,  pigs,  camels,  and  hippopotami  (Thewissen  et  al.  2009).  From  all  extant 

artiodactyls,  hippopotami  are  the  closest  relatives  of  whales  (Gatesy  et  al.  2013). 

However,  cetaceans  evolved  about  47  million  years  ago  from  a  small  deer-like 

ancestor (Thewissen et al. 2009).

Chapter 1: Introduction 

The  phenotypic  differences  between  cetaceans  and  artiodactyls  are  striking. 

Indeed, whales show many analogous characteristics with other marine species given 

that  their  “new”  aquatic  environment  required  many  profound  adaptions,  while 

artiodactyls remained in the terrestrial environment that is characterized by different, 

partly opposite constraints  (e.g. gravity, body dehydration).  In the following section 

we  give  a  summary  of  what  is  known  about  the  Umwelt  of  deer,  a  family  that  is 

phylogenetically close to cetaceans, and about the Umwelt of cuttlefish, an order that 

shares the same environment as cetaceans.  

 

2.1.  The Umwelt of deer 

Deer  (Cervidae)  are  prey  species  that  live  primarily  in  forests  but  inhabit  also 

tundra, grassy landscape or mountainous areas (Geist 2009). All these habitats exhibit 

high luminosity  contrasts  and colours, as  well as a large range of potential  predators. 

Hence, deer’s visual system is adapted to visually contrasted habitats like forests, thus 

possessing  a  high  visual  sensitivity  in  low-light  conditions  (e.g.  due  to  a  tapetum 

lucidum).  The  highly  developed  vision  is  also  advantageous  for  a  crepuscular  prey 

species as it facilitates the detection of predators (D’Angelo et al. 2008; VerCauteren & 

Pipas  2003).  Behavioural  tests  proved  the  assumption  that  deer  can  perceive  colours 

(Birgersson et al. 2001) which is suggested to further enhance their predator-detection 

capabilities (VerCauteren & Pipas 2003). Colour vision is thought to be used also in the 

context of food selection: deer are herbivorous, selecting suitable diet (plant species or 

different parts of plants) probably using vision (VerCauteren & Pipas 2003) and odour 

(Tixier  et  al.  1998).  Chemoreception  is  further  used  in  intra-specific  communication: 

male deer use excretions,  for example from  the preorbital  gland, for scent marks  that 

are sniffed by both males and females (Mary & Balakrishnan 1984). Chemical analyses 

revealed  that  several  deer  species  possess  excretions  that  differ  significantly  in 

composition  depending  on  population,  sex,  and  age  (Lawson  et  al.  2001),  but  also 

between hierarchical  status  (Miller et  al.  1998).  In visually restricted habitats  such as 

forests,  acoustic  signals  are  advantageous  because  they  propagate  omnidirectionally 

and are less affected by dense vegetation than visual signals (Catchpole & Slater 1995; 

Marler 1965). Deer are highly vocal during the reproductive season, where males roar

Chapter 1: Introduction 

intensively.  Roaring  rate  is  assumed  to  be  an  honest  indicator  of  a  male’s  fighting 

ability  (Clutton-Brock  &  Albon  1979).  While  males  use  this  signal  to  evaluate  the 

roaring competitor, females are attracted to males with higher roaring rates (McComb 

1987). Some frequency  parameters of the  roars  provide honest  (because  anatomically 

limited) information about the caller’s age, body weight, and reproductive success, that 

might  be  used  by  other  males  for  rival  assessment  and  by  females  for  mate  choice 

(Charlton et al. 2007; Reby & McComb 2003). Indeed, female deer show a preference 

for high-pitched roars that are indicative of reproductive success  in males, thus  using 

the  acoustic  information  about  the  caller  provided  by  frequency  parameters  (Reby  & 

McComb  2003;  Reby  et  al.  2010). While vocalizations  are very important during the 

breeding season, deer are much less vocal at other periods of the year and rely strongly 

on vision. 

 

2.2.  The Umwelt of cuttlefish 

Cuttlefish  (Sepiida)  are  predatory  cephalopods  primarily  inhabiting  shallow-

water  areas  of  temperate  oceans.  Their  habitat  is  characterized  by  polarized  light, 

numerous  possible  predator  and  prey  species,  as  well  as  a  three-dimensional  space. 

Consequently, cuttlefish’s highly developed visual system is used for navigation (Alves 

et al. 2009), camouflage adaption (Kelman et al. 2008), and prey detection (Messenger 

1989;  Shashar  et  al.  2000).  The  cuttlefish’s  pupil  changes  its  form  depending  on  the 

light condition: it is O-shaped in darkness and W-shaped in bright light to improve the 

image contrast (Mäthger et al. 2013). Although colour blind (Mäthger et al. 2006), they 

have an overall good vision (Marshall & Messenger 1996). Furthermore, cuttlefish are 

sensitive  to  polarization  characteristics  of  the  light  (Shashar  et  al.  1996).  This 

sensitivity  improves  their  object  recognition  (Cartron  et  al.  2013)  and  their  prey 

detection abilities (Shashar et al. 2000). In general, cuttlefish are visual predators, able 

for example to estimate the distance of their prey (Messenger 1968). Although they can 

detect chemical cues of prey (Boal & Golden 1999), they do not approach the odour in 

the  absence  of  a  visual  cue  (Guibé  et  al.  2010).  However,  odour  and  taste  play  an 

important role: prey preferences seem to be odour-driven and taste seems to guide food 

evaluation  (Darmaillacq  et  al.  2004;  Guibé  et  al.  2010).  Other  salient  environmental 

 

6 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

features such as predators, conspecifics, or water composition can also be detected by 

odours (Boal & Golden 1999). For example, female cuttlefish can detect if a male has 

recently mated on the basis of chemical cues alone and they show preference for such 

males (Boal 1997). The sensory systems are already functional in 25 days old cuttlefish 

embryos, which respond to light stimuli, the odour of predators, and touch (Romagny 

et  al.  2012).  Adult  cuttlefish  also  respond  to  mechanical  stimuli:  epidermal  receptors 

comparable to the lateral line organ in fish (Budelmann & Bleckmann 1988) allow the 

perception of local water movements (Komak et al. 2005).  

To  summarize,  both  deer  and  cuttlefish,  which  are  respectively  close  relatives 

and  habitat  neighbours  of  cetaceans,  are  highly  visual  species.  Although  deer  and 

cuttlefish  are  phylogenetically  not  very  close,  similar  environmental  constraints, 

particularly  a  visually  restricted  habitat,  seem  to  have  favoured  similar  sensory 

adaption.  However,  with  regard  to  the  other  sensory  modalities,  both  species  have 

different well-developed senses. While deer rely strongly on acoustic signals at certain 

times  of  the  year  (Clutton-Brock  &  Albon  1979),  cuttlefish  have  no  underwater 

audition (Budelmann & Bleckmann 1988). These common features and differences in 

the Umwelt of deer and cuttlefish raise the question about characteristics of the Umwelt 

of a cetacean species.   

 

3.  WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE UMWELT OF DOLPHINS?  

The  order  Cetacea  comprises  two  suborders,  Mysticeti  and  Odontoceti.  Both 

suborders are different in terms of morphology, feeding ecology, habitat and behaviour, 

wherefore knowledge gained about mysticete species can be generalized to odontocete 

species (and vice versa) only with caution if at all. Mysticeti differ from Odontoceti in 

their  lack  of  teeth;  instead  they  possess  a  filter-feeding  apparatus  made  up  of  baleen 

plates  to  feed  on  zooplankton  and  small  fish  (Bannister  2009).  They  are  generally 

larger than odontocete cetaceans (e.g. blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus, with >30 m 

and  >170  tons  the  largest  known  animal),  mostly  living  in  the  open  ocean  and 

undertaking long migrations. Therefore, a general “cetacean Umwelt” does not exist. A 

more species-specific perspective is required to approach the Umwelt. The odontocete 

family Delphinidae includes the best studied cetacean species, wherefore they present a 

 

7 

suitable model to outline their Umwelt. The analysis of the dolphin’s world must begin 

with  a review of the sensory information  available to  dolphins,  which is  given in  the 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

following paragraphs.  

 

3.1.  Audition 

Most research effort has been made in the study of dolphins’ audition. Audition is 

the ability to hear, meaning the detection of sound. Sound is an oscillation of pressure 

(wave) transmitted through air, water, or another medium, that travels five times faster 

in  water than in  air. The frequency of the wave determines  the pitch of a sound, (i.e. 

low vs. high). For a given sound frequency, the wavelength is nearly five times longer 

in water than in air. Generally, high frequencies attenuate rapidly and do not carry very 

far  compared  to  low  frequencies  (Nummela  2009).  Hearing  is  evaluated  by 

electrophysiological 

(auditory  evoked  potential)  or  behavioural  audiograms. 

Odontocetes  tend  to  have  a  10-octave  functional  hearing  range  with  peak  sensitivity 

between  40  and  80  kHz  (Warzok  &  Ketten  1999).  In  bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops 

truncatus), hearing ranges up to 150 kHz, with best sensitivity at 10-80 kHz (Houser & 

Finneran 2006). The morphology of the odontocete ear, that is exclusively adapted for 

underwater hearing, differs from that of other mammals already by the lack of outer ear 

pinnae. Middle and inner ear are located together in the tympano-periotic complex that 

is  surrounded  by  air  cushions  in  order  to  acoustically  isolate  the  ear  from  the  skull 

(Nummela 2009). The primary sound perception path is considered to be the lower jaw 

that receives the sound energy and transmits it through a fatty tissue in the mandibular 

canal  (mandibular fat  pad) up to  the tympanic plate (Nummela 2009). This  fat  pad is 

composed  of  triacylglycerol,  being  similar  in  density  and  thus  acoustic  impedance  to 

water (Varanasi & Malins 1971).  

Delphinids  produce  three  different  categories  of  vocalizations:  clicks,  burst-

pulsed  sounds  and  whistles  (Janik  2009).  Clicks  are  short  broadband  signals  that  can 

exceed 100 kHz (Richardson et al. 1995) and are mostly used for echolocation. Burst-

pulsed sounds consist of rapid click trains (Janik 2009) that are highly directional (Au 

& Hastings 2008). Into this category fall bottlenose dolphins’ bray calls (Janik 2000a), 

the so called “squawks”, “yelps” and “barks” (Schultz et al. 1995) as well as “moans” 

 

8 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

or  “rasps”  (Caldwell  &  Caldwell  1967).  The  distinction  between  echolocation  clicks 

and  burst-pulsed  sounds  is  not  always  easy.  Some  authors  describe  a  fluent  passage 

between these two categories of vocalizations and that they may merge into the other 

during sound emission (Au & Hastings 2008). Whistles are tonal, frequency modulated 

signals  with  fundamental  frequencies  lying  between  800  Hz  (Schultz  &  Corkeron 

1994)  and  28.5  kHz  (May-Collado  &  Wartzok  2008)  and  often  several  harmonics. 

Whistles  and  burst-pulsed  sounds  can  be  produced  simultaneously  (Janik  2009).  This 

corresponds  with  the  generally  accepted  concept  that  there  are  two  sites  of  sound 

production that can be controlled independently (Dormer 1979), that are composed of 

two identical sound producing structures consisting of fatty dorsal bursae within a pair 

of phonic lips, one in the left and one in the right nasal passage (Cranford 2000). 

There  are  two  main  functions  of  hearing  in  dolphins:  communication  and 

echolocation  (see  below).  In  a  habitat  where  visual  contact  is  not  always  given, 

acoustic  signals  provide  a  good  communication  channel  even  for  long-range 

communication.  Most  delphinids  use  whistles  for  communication,  but  also  pulse 

sound-based  communication  exists  (e.g.  Commerson’s  dolphins,  Cephalorhynchus 

commersonii; Yoshida et al. 2010). Why some delphinid and other odontocete species 

(e.g. the family of Phocoenidae (porpoises), the pygmy sperm whale, Kogia breviceps, 

and  the  genus  of  Pontoporia)  not  produce  whistles  but  only  pulse  sounds  was 

connected  to  the  orca  (Orcinus  orca)  predation  risk,  that  lead  to  a  selective  pressure 

favouring  vocalizations  restricted  to  sounds  that  orcas  hear  poorly  or  not  at  all  (i.e. 

below  2  and  above  100  kHz;  Morisaka  &  Connor  2007).  Most  studies  on  delphinid 

communication  are  concerned  with  whistles  because  they  are  thought  to  play  an 

important  role  in  social  interactions  for  most  delphinid  species  (Díaz  López  2010). 

Whistles have varying numbers  of harmonics  and delphinids  can distinguish between 

whistles  with  and  without  harmonics  (Yuen  et  al.  2007)  but  it  is  unclear  which 

information might be encoded in the harmonics. Whereas the fundamental frequency is 

relatively  omnidirectional,  higher  order  harmonics  are  more  directional  (Lammers  & 

Au 2003). Bottlenose dolphins can discriminate tonal sounds that differ in frequency by 

only 0.2 to 0.8 % (Thompson & Herman 1975) but they seem to pay attention rather to 

the  frequency  modulation  than  to  the  absolute  frequency  (Ralston  &  Herman  1995). 

 

9 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

The  active  space  (i.e.  the  transmission  range  over  which  a  signal  can  be  detected  by 

conspecifics)  for  bottlenose  dolphins’  whistles  is  determined  as  10  to  20  km  for 

frequencies  below  12  kHz  (Janik  2000b).  However,  the  active  space  of  a  sound 

depends  (among  other  factors  such  as  its  frequency)  on  bottom  substrate  and  water 

depth.  Thus,  the  same  call  can  be  perceptible  less  than  200 m  in  a  shallow  sea  grass 

area  of  1.6  m  depth  or  more  than  6  km  in  a  sandy  bottom  area  of  3.5  m  depth 

(Quintana-Rizzo et al. 2006). 

The ontogeny of whistle repertoire is mainly driven by vocal learning. Neonatal 

bottlenose  dolphins  produce  whistles  as  well  as  burst-pulsed  sounds  just  after  birth 

(Morisaka et al. 2005). With the ability of vocal learning, delphinids are able to acquire 

and  modify  new  signals  in  their  vocal  repertoire  through  the  use  of  auditory 

information  and  feedback,  thus  infants’  and  adults’  vocal  repertoires  are  different 

(McCowan  &  Reiss  1997).  Janik  (2009)  described  two  different  way  of  learning  that 

can influence the vocal development: contextual learning and production learning. He 

outlined  that  in  contextual  leaning  animals  learn  an  association  between  an  existing 

signal and its context. This context can be a specific behavioural context or a temporal 

position in a sequence of signals (Janik & Slater 2000). If applied to sound production, 

this  requires  control  over  the  delivery  of  signals  that  are  already  in  the  repertoire,  so 

that  they  can  be  produced  in  novel  contexts  (Janik  2009).  Production  learning  is 

defined as instances when the vocalizations themselves are modified in form as a result 

of  experience  with  those  of  other  individuals;  vocal  production  learning  is  relatively 

rare and has only been identified in some bird and mammal species (Janik 2009). The 

dolphins’ ability of vocal leaning is not restricted to a critical or sensitive period as in 

birds  but  they  retain  this  ability  through  their  whole  life  lime  (McCowan  &  Reiss 

1997). The use of copying is evident in vocal matching interactions, in which animals 

respond to a conspecific’s whistle with the same whistle type within a short time (Janik 

2000c). The occurrence of the same whistle type in the repertoires of two individuals is 

called vocal sharing, what seems to be frequent in delphinids (e.g. bottlenose dolphins: 

Azevedoa et al. 2007; McCowan & Reiss 1997; orcas: Ford 1989; Ford 1991; Yurk et 

al. 2002; see Annex for vocal sharing at the group level in captive orcas). Delphinids 

are also able to copy non-conspecific sounds from their environment (Foote et al. 2006; 

 

10 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

Reiss & McCowan 1993; Richards et al. 1984) and to associate a given sound with an 

object  or  context  (Reiss  &  McCowan  1993;  Richards  et  al.  1984).  However,  why 

dolphins  copy  a  certain  sound  of  their  environment  but  not  another,  is  still  unclear. 

Perhaps  the  meaning  of  the  object  or  context  to  the  dolphin  plays  a  crucial  role. 

Although  there  is  a  huge  amount  of  studies  concerning  the  vocal  communication  of 

delphinids,  many  questions  are  still  open  due  to  technical  and  methodological 

constraints, such as individually assigned recordings (that are not impossible but often 

expensive) and unlimited access to the animals. The latter concerns especially studies 

with  direct  observation  of  free-ranging  cetaceans,  which  are  not  always  easy  to  find 

and  to  follow  wherefore  most  studies  are  restricted  to  convenient  weather  conditions 

and particularly daytime permitting boat trips, leaving the activity at other time periods 

nearly unknown. 

Another important function of sound for odontocetes is echolocation, where they 

emit sound pulses and listen for returning echoes to generate an auditory scene of their 

surrounding  for  navigation  and  foraging  (Madsen  &  Surlykke  2013;  Thomas  et  al. 

2004). Shorter wavelengths  have a better spatial  resolution,  thus  high frequencies are 

better suitable for detecting small objects than are low frequencies (Nummela 2009). In 

line  with  this,  species  inhabiting  acoustically  complex  inshore  and  river  waters  use 

higher  frequencies  for  echolocation  (>100  kHz)  than  near-  and  offshore  species 

(<100 kHz)  that  inhabit  low  object  density  environments  (Warzok  &  Ketten  1999). 

Echolocation and sound location are facilitated by rapid auditory temporal processing 

(Nummela 2009). Beside echolocation, some delphinids are known to detect their prey 

by passive listening, meaning that they use the sounds produced by their prey to locate 

it.  Noise-producing  fish  make  up  indeed  a  large  part  of  the  bottlenose  dolphin’s  diet 

(Gannon et al. 2005). 

In odontocetes, hearing is considered to be the most important sensory modality 

(e.g. Thewissen 2009) as it is involved in navigation, prey location, and communication 

(e.g.  Mooney  et  al.  2012).  Consequently,  the  majority  of  studies  address  questions 

related  to  hearing,  sound  production,  echolocation  and  communication.  At  the  same 

time, other sensory modalities are considered to be less important (e.g. Marriott et al. 

2013) and therefore reduced or even absent because of trade-offs among the modalities 

 

11 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

other modalities. 

 

3.2.  Vision 

(Nummela et al. 2013). The following paragraphs will outline what is known about the 

Another  important  sense  to  perceive  the  environment  is  vision.  Vision  is  the 

ability to see, meaning the detection of light. When light passes through the water it is 

differently absorbed, refracted and scattered, depending on the wavelength of the light 

and  the  concentration  and  type  of  dissolved  material  in  the  water.  In  coastal  waters, 

light of longer wavelength is transmitted better, whereas in the open ocean this is true 

for  light  of  shorter  wavelength  (Warzok  &  Ketten  1999).  In  general,  light  decreases 

with  depth.  In  marine  mammals  (cetaceans  and  pinnipeds),  visual  sensitivity  is 

maximized  by  a  high  density  of  photoreceptors  (400 000  per  mm²  in  bottlenose 

dolphins;  Dral  1977)  and  a  tapetum  lucidum,  i.e.  a  reflective  layer  behind  the  retina, 

that  is  reported  to  be  the  most  developed  of  any  mammal  (Dawson  1980).  Dolphins 

have  a  very  good  underwater  and  in-air  vision  (Herman  et  al.  1975)  and  excellent 

distance estimation (Mobley & Helweg 1990). Both rod and cone receptors have been 

described  in  their  retina  (Perez  et  al.  1972).  Nevertheless,  they  lack  the  common 

dichromatic vision typical for many terrestrial mammals and are probably colourblind 

(Mass & Supin 2009). The lens of the cetacean eye is very strong and more similar to 

those in fish compared to the lens of terrestrial mammals (Warzok & Ketten 1999). The 

delphinid  pupil  is  round  under  low-light  conditions  and  roughly  U-shaped  in  bright 

light conditions (Mass & Supin 2009). The cetacean eyes are located laterally (directed 

ventronasally),  allowing  a  panoramic  vision  with  a  120-130°  visual  field,  and  are 

protected  by  several  anatomical  structures  inside  the  eyes  from  mechanical  damage 

(e.g. due to water pressure) or cooling (Mass & Supin 2009). Both eyes are mobile and 

are moved independently from each other (Mass & Supin 2009).  

Delphinids  use  their  sense  of  sight  in  a  variety  of  contexts,  from  social 

interactions to prey capture. In short-range communication, visual displays are known 

to  play  an  important  role  for  delphinids.  Postures  are  thought  to  signal  intent  and 

demeanour  of  the  signal  emitter  (Dudzinski  1996).  The  ‘S’-posture,  in  which  the 

dolphin’s  body  is  bend  into  an  S-shape  (head  pointing  down,  pectoral  fins  stretched 

 

12 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

out),  is  often  described  in  association  with  aggressive  behaviour  including  sexual 

interactions  as  well  as  disciplinary  behaviour  towards  infants  (Bojaniwski  2002; 

Dudzinski 1996). The ‘S-posture’ is known as aggressive stance from other cetaceans 

too  (e.g.  humpback  whales,  Megaptera  novaeangliae)  and  might  be  comparable  with 

the arched head and arched neck position known in many terrestrial mammals during 

aggressive  displays  (Dudzinski  1996).  The  dolphin’s  ‘head-to-head’  posture  is  often 

accompanied by ‘jaw claps’, hits, tail hits and ‘squawks’ (burst-pulsed sounds) that are 

thought  to  express  irritation  or  anger  (Au  &  Hastings  2008;  Dudzinski  1996).  ‘Jaw 

claps’  are  ‘head  jerks’  also  described  by  Connor  et  al.  (2000)  to  be  included  in 

aggressive  behaviours.  Furthermore,  they  mention  a  distinct  posture,  in  which  the 

dolphin  arches  the  head  and  flukes  down,  which  may  be  used  to  threaten  another 

dolphin. Affiliation between individuals is, among others, expressed by proximity and 

synchronous  movements  (Connor  et  al.  2000)  and  both  could  be  enhanced  by  visual 

acuity. Further, there is some evidence that dolphins use pointing gestures (Xitco et al. 

2001)  and  that  complex  behaviours  such  foraging  techniques  are  taught  by  action 

imitation that in turn requires observation (Abramson et al. 2013; Bender et al. 2009). 

Another  visual  display  occurs  in  reproductive  contexts,  when  dolphins  present  their 

genital  region  to  sexually  attract  their  mating  partner  (Tyack  2000).  In  addition,  the 

normally white ventral side of bottlenose dolphins can be remarkable pink in periods of 

high sexual activity (personal observation) what might serve as a visual signal. 

But  also  the  inspection  of  objects,  both  in  water  and  in  air,  suggests  that 

cetaceans  use  their  vision  to  perceive  their  surroundings.  A  common  behaviour  of 

several cetacean species is spyhopping, i.e. surfacing vertically and lifting the head out 

of  the  water  (e.g.  Jensen  et  al.  2013;  Ford  1984;  Whitehead  &  Weilgart  1991)  that 

seems  to  serve  the  inspection  of  objects  over  water  (Madsen  &  Herman  1980). 

Furthermore, dolphins  can visually  track  fish that is  flying through the  air (after they 

had hit them very hard with their fluke) and catch them (Wells et al. 1987). 

 

3.3.  Somatosensory perception 

Somatosensory perception comprises the perception of touch, pain (nociception), 

temperature,  and  body  position  (proprioception).  Several  different  receptors  types  are 

 

13 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

involved  (including  mechanoreceptors,  nociceptors,  and  thermoreceptors)  that  are 

located in the skin and inside the body. To be able to feel the body position is crucial 

for an air-breathing animal that lives in a three-dimensional underwater habitat in order 

to orient towards the surface even when no visual cues are available and to feel if the 

blowhole  is  above  the  water  (to  ensure  respiration).  The  cetacean  skin  is  well 

innervated  and  very  sensitive  to  touch  (Tyack  2000).  Dolphins  are  most  sensitive  on 

their  heads  (corners  of  the  mouth,  eyes,  snout,  melon,  area  around  the  blowhole), 

reaching  a  sensitivity  comparable  to  human  fingertips  or  lips  (Ridgway  &  Carder 

1990). In the region of the blowhole, large numbers of mechanoreceptors were found 

that  are  thought  to  serve  in  the  perception  of  pressure  change  that  occurs  when  the 

whale/dolphin breaks through the water surface in order to assure that the blowhole is 

opened for  respiration only after surfacing (Bryden & Molyneux 1986). Dolphins are 

able to perceive pressures as small as 100 mg/mm² (Kolchin & Bel’kovich).  

Beside  the  surrounding  water,  somatic  stimuli  can  originate  from  objects  in  the 

environment.  Rubbing  occurs  in  both  captive  and  free-ranging  cetaceans.  Several 

delphinids rub body parts on the substrate, for example pebbles,  sand, or along rocky 

edges (Ford 2009; Rossi-Santos & Wedekin 2006; Smith et al. 1992; Whitehead et al. 

2004), what possibly functions in pleasure or hygiene (Dudzinski et al. 2012) but may 

also  be  a  result  of  play  behaviour  (Kuczaj  et  al.  2006).  However,  touch  is  also  an 

important  short range  communication  signal  during play, sexual,  maternal,  and social 

contexts using the nose or rostrum, ﬂippers, pectoral ﬁns, dorsal ﬁn, ﬂukes, abdomen, 

and  the  entire  body  (Dudzinski  et  al.  2009a).  Tactile  contacts  between  dolphin 

conspecifics can be observed during aggressive interactions (including also biting etc.) 

but  are  also  common  in  affiliative  contexts  (Dudzinski  et  al.  2009b;  Dudzinski  et  al. 

2010;  Dudzinski  et  al.  2012;  Paulos  et  al.  2008).  Affiliation  between  individuals  is 

expressed  by  proximity  and  physical  contact  (Connor  et  al.  2000).  Physical  contact 

includes  contact  swimming,  gentle  stroking  with  the  pectoral  fin  or  rubbing  against 

another individual. Sakai et al. (2006) reported that flipper rubbing in wild Indo-Pacific 

bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  aduncus)  is  an  affiliative  behaviour  which  could  be  a 

quantitative  measure  of  social  relationships  among  individuals.  Tamaki  et  al.  (2006) 

reported  that  flipper-rubbing  may  contribute  to  restore  friendly  relationships  between 

 

14 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

former  opponents  or  reduce  conflicts.  Thus,  flipper-rubbing  may  be  the  cetacean 

equivalent of primate grooming (Connor 2007; Norris et al. 1994; Tamaki et al. 2006). 

People  working  with  delphinids  in  captivity  report  that  petting  is  appreciated  by  the 

animals  and can be therefore used as  a reinforcer in  training (Dudzinski et  al.  2009a; 

personal observation). 

3.4.  Chemoreception 

 

 

Especially in aquatic species it is difficult to differentiate the different modalities 

of  chemoreception,  i.e.  gustation,  olfaction,  and  the  vomeronasal  sense  (Hemilä  & 

Reuter  2008).  Chemoreception  is  sensitive  to  all  substances  spread  by  water,  air,  or 

direct  contact  that  can  be  perceived  by  the  chemical  sense  organs  (Hemilä  &  Reuter 

2008).  As  cetaceans  lack  the  vomeronasal  organ  (Thewissen  2009),  the  following 

section will focus on gustation and olfaction.  

3.4.1. Gustation 

Gustation  is  the  ability  to  taste.  Waterborne  tastants  (i.e.  substances  that 

elicit  gustatory  excitation)  are  hydrophilic  substances,  for  example  amino  acids 

or  nucleotides,  that  are  carried  by  water  currents  (Hemilä  &  Reuter  2008).  In 
water, the diffusion of molecules is slower than in air (10-9 m²/s versus 10-5 m²/s; 

Dusenbery  1992).  Traditionally,  gustation  provides  information  about  food 

material already in the mouth, where the taste is perceived by the receptor cells of 

the taste buds that are located on the tongue, the roof of the mouth, the epiglottis, 

and the oesophagus (Purves et al. 2001). Several authors suggested that cetaceans 

in  general  and  odontocetes  in  particular  should  have  taste  sensation  (Pihlström 

2008; Pfeiffer et al. 2001; Watkins & Wartzok 1985). However, evidence in the 

literature is difficult to find and only those in favour of gustation in dolphins will 

be  given  hereafter  (for  a  more  comprehensive  review  see  Chapter  4).  A  taste 

system comparable to that of other mammals might exist in bottlenose dolphins. 

First, on the dolphin’s tongue have been found taste buds (reviewed in Kuznetzov 

1990),  marginal  and  vallate  papillae  (known  to  be  potential  locations  of  taste 

buds; Kastelein & Dubbeldam 1990; Werth 2007), as well as cells that resemble 

 

15 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

Von  Ebner’s  glands  (also  called  gustatory  glands;  Ferrando  et  al.  2010)  that 

might  be  chemosensory  or  important  for  the  sense  of  taste.  Second,  it  was 

proposed  that  the  very  well  developed  cranial  nerve V  (trigeminal  nerve; 

Oelschläger  2008)  might  provide  a  pathway  to  transmit  impulses  from  the  oral 

cavity  to  the  brain  (Oelschläger  &  Oelschläger  2009),  called  trigeminal 

chemoreception  (Kuznetzov  1990).  Unlike  other  mammals,  where  cranial 

nerve VII innervates the tongue’s taste buds (Purves et al. 2001), this nerve does 

not seem to be involved in dolphins’ chemoreception but rather in acoustic signal 

production  (Oelschläger  2008).  However,  cranial  nerve  V  is,  just  as  cranial 

nerve VII, able to excite the gustatory neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract 

in the medulla (Boucher et al. 2003; Purves et al. 2001). 

Furthermore, behavioural studies have shown that bottlenose dolphins can 

perceive sour and bitter (Friedl  et  al.  1990;  Kuznetzov 1990; Nachtigall  & Hall 

1984) nearly as well as humans; moreover, they were able to detect salty (Friedl 

et  al.  1990;  Kuznetzov  1990).  Regarding  the  perception  of  sweet,  there  is 

evidence for both presence (Friedl et al. 1990) and absence (Kuznetzov 1990). In 

addition  to  the  basic  tastes,  dolphins  were  also  able  to  detect  urine  and  faeces 

(Kuznetzov 1990). Dolphins’ high sensitivity to  some carboxylic  acids,  that  are 

not  perceived  by  taste  but  primarily  by  smell  in  other  mammals  (odorous 

substances), led to the hypothesis that dolphins do not possess a sense of taste or 

smell  in  its  typical  form  but  rather  a  chemical  sense  called  “quasi-olfaction” 

(Kuznetzov 1990) as it combines characteristics of both taste and olfaction.  

Known  tastants  such as  amino acids  or nucleotides can be unintentionally 

released  into  the  water  by  other  animals,  for  example  prey  species  (Hemilä  & 

Reuter  2008),  and  provide  therefore  a  possible  cue  for  finding  food  (Würsig 

1986)  or  evaluating  food  quality.  However,  these  questions  have  not  been 

investigated  so  far.  Given  the  fact  that  dolphins  seem  to  be  able  to  detect 

excrements (Kuznetzov 1990), gustation could also be used intra-specifically, for 

example  individual  recognition  or  mate  detection  (e.g.  females’  receptiveness). 

The  idea  of  pheromone  mediated  behaviour  was  already  suggested  for  spinner 

dolphins (Stenella longirostris; Norris 1991).

Chapter 1: Introduction 

3.4.2. Olfaction 

Olfaction is the ability to smell and is considered to be the most primordial, 

meaning  the  “oldest”,  sense  (Purves  et  al.  2001).  Airborne  odourants  (i.e. 

substances  that  elicit  olfactory  excitation)  are  volatile  molecules,  for  example 

alcohol  or  fatty  acids,  carried  by  air  (Hemilä  &  Reuter  2008).  In  terrestrial 

mammals, odourants dissolve in the olfactory epithelium inside the nasal cavity, 

where they bind  to  olfactory  receptor  cells  that transmit  the impulse further via 

cranial  nerve  I  (olfactory  nerve;  Thewissen  2009).  Even  when  the  detected 

chemicals  are  carried  in  water,  when  the  transmission  pathway  to  the  central 

nervous system is via cranial nerve I it is considered to be olfaction, as it is the 

case in fish (Hara 1994). Therefore, olfaction is also possible in water and does 

not necessarily require olfactory receptor cells in the nasal cavity. 

In  odontocetes,  the  nasal  cavity  accommodates  parts  of  the  echolocation 

system  (Pihlström  2008)  wherefore  a  traditional  involvement  in  olfaction  may 

seem  unlikely. However, chemoreceptor cells  were found in  the nasal cavity of 

harbour porpoises  (Phocoena phocoena;  Behrman 1989). Cranial nerve  I seems 

to vanish during early ontogenesis (Oelschläger & Buhl 1985). In baleen whales, 

the  olfactory  tract  is  reported  to  be  either  considerably  reduced/absent 

(Oelschläger  2008;  Pihlström  2008)  or  present  (Thewissen  et  al.  2011).  In 

toothed whales, the olfactory tract is considered to be absent (Oelschläger 2008; 

Pihlström  2008),  but  the  olfactory  tubercle  was  found  to  be  well-developed 

(Oelschläger & Oelschläger 2009).  

As  other  marine  but  air-breathing  species,  including  another  marine 

mammal  (the  harbour  seal,  Phoca  vitulina  vitulina),  use  odours  to  locate  prey 

(Kowalewsky et al. 2006; Nevitt et al. 1995; Wright et al. 2011), it was suggested 

that  bowhead  whales  (Balaena  mysticetus)  and  humpback  whales  may  have  a 

functional  sense  of  smell  that  is  used  to  detect  prey  (Hagelin  et  al.  2012; 

Thewissen  et  al.  2011).  The  same  could  be  true  for  dolphins,  by  using  either 

airborne molecules as proposed before or waterborne molecules as fish do (Hara 

1994). Beside prey detection, fish are able to perceive olfactory cues of predators 

and  conspecifics  (Hirvonen  et  al.  2000),  what  could  be  useful  information  for 

 

17 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

dolphins, too. But again, these ideas have not been investigated yet in dolphins. 

Furthermore,  individual  recognition  or  mate  detection  could  be  chemically 

mediated,  and  as  the  chemical  sense  in  dolphins  is  not  clearly  described 

(gustation, olfaction, “quasi-olfaction”) involvement of smell cannot be ruled out. 

  

3.5.  Electro-/Magnetoreception 

3.5.1. Electroreception 

Electroreception  is  the  ability  to  perceive  an  electric  field.  Bioelectrical 

fields are generated by every muscle movement and the water medium provides 

best conditions for conducting the currents. In active electroreception, the animal 

generates  an  electric  field  and  senses  distortion  of  this  field  from  objects  of 

varying  conductivity  in  its  habitat;  in  passive  electroreception,  the  animal 

perceives  electric  fields  generated  by  an  object  in  vicinity  (Czech-Damal  et  al. 

2012).  Active  electroreception 

is  known  for  example 

in  electric  eels 

(Electrophorus electricus; Souza et al. 2007). Passive electroreception is used for 

prey detection for example by  elasmobranch fishes  (Kalmijn 1971) that possess 

electroreceptors called ampullae of Lorenzini (Murray 1960). 

So  far,  the  Guiana  dolphin  (Sotalia  guianensis)  has  been  found  to  be 

sensitive to weak electric currents such as those emitted by the muscles  of prey 

fish buried in  the sediment  (Czech-Damal  et  al.  2012). The electroreceptors  are 

probably  in  the  hairless  vibrissal  crypts  on  the  rostrum  (Czech-Damal  et  al. 

2013).  These  structures  are  also  present  in  bottlenose  dolphins.  Interestingly, 

most fish prey species in the bottlenose dolphins’ diet are bottom-dwellers (Wells 

&  Scott  2009).  Thus,  the  perception  of  electric  fields  would  improve  prey 

detection. 

 

3.5.2. Magnetoreception 

Magnetoreception  is  the  ability  to  perceive  a  magnetic  field.  The  Earth’s 

magnetic field is a dipole field that is generated by the generated by Earth’s fluid 

outer  iron  core  (Wiltschko  &  Wiltschko  1995).  Its  intensity  ranges  from  over 

60 000 nT  near  the  magnetic  poles  to  30 000 nT  at  the  magnetic  equator,  but 

 

18 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

shows minimum values below 26 000 nT at  the east  coast  of South  America.  In 

the ocean, the magnetic topography (i.e. variation in the magnetic field) is regular 

and  long-term  stable,  with  hills  (i.e.  locally  higher  total  intensities)  and  valleys 

(i.e. locally lower intensities) symmetrically  arranged on both sides  of the mid-

oceanic ridge; there are some anomalies that run linear on opposite sides of the 

ridge  and  some  that  run  perpendicular  to  those  (reviewed  in  Walker  &  Dennis 

2005).  Local  anomalies  can  be  caused  by  differently  magnetized  rocks 

(Wiltschko  &  Wiltschko  1995).  Beside  spatial  variation  the  geomagnetic  field 

also shows temporal variation caused by solar electromagnetic radiation (leading 

to regular daily variations) or sun spot activity (leading to irregular fluctuations 

called magnetic storms; Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1995). 

Two  main  principles  are  the  perception  of  a  magnetic  field  based  on 

induction or based on magnetite (reviewed in Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1995). The 

theory  of  induction-based  perception  assumes  that  the  electric  field,  which  is 

generated by the magnetic field, is perceived by electroreceptors; it is dependent 

on the conductivity of the surrounding medium,  thus  salt water provides  a very 

suitable medium. Magnetite-based perception is based on ferromagnetic particles 

such as magnetite (iron oxide). These miniature magnets align themselves in the 

magnetic  field  and  are  connected  to  the  central  nervous  system.  However,  the 

exact pathways of the signal transmission are still unclear (Lohnmann & Johnsen 

2000). Magnetite has been found in the dura mater of bottlenose dolphins (Bauer 

et al. 1985) and short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) where nerve 

fibres have been identified on the particles’ surface (Zoeger et al. 1981).  

Magnetoreception  is  commonly  used  for  navigation,  i.e.  orientation  based 

on  the  geomagnetic  field  (reviewed  in  Wiltschko  &  Wiltschko  1995).  As 

navigational  cues  such  as  land  marks  are  limited  in  oceans,  magnetoreception 

could  serve  dolphins  for  orientation,  as  it  was  suggested  for  fin  whales 

(Balaenoptera  physalus;  Walker  et  al.  1992),  but  experimental  evidence  is 

lacking.

Chapter 1: Introduction 

4.  OPEN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE UMWELT OF DOLPHINS 

The aim of this thesis is to contribute to a better understanding of the dolphin’s Umwelt 

by  filling  some  of  the  knowledge  gaps.  Up  to  now,  the  dolphin’s  Umwelt  has  only  been 

outlined in parts. With regard to audition, vision, and somatosensory perception, where main 

research effort has been made, the dolphin’s Umwelt is relatively well-understood. 

Some of the senses are temporally independent, meaning that they are functional at any 

time of the day. Contrarily, vision is generally limited to day time. Because visual restriction 

often enhances the use of acoustic signals, the use of vocalizations might be different at night 

compared  to  day  time.  As  outlined  above,  most  studies  on  dolphin  vocal  behaviour  are 

conducted at day. In contrast to most other mammals, cetaceans do not have a diurnal activity 

rhythm  (i.e.  being  awake  during  the  day  and  sleeping  during  the  night)  due  to  their 

unihemispheric sleep (Lyamin et al. 2008). Consequently, nighttime cannot automatically be 

considered  as  inactivity  but  has  to  be  seen  as  an  equally  important  part  of  the  dolphin’s 

Umwelt. When not being (entirely) sleeping at night, dolphins can be expected to be engaged 

in  different  activities  or  social  behaviours  and  given  the  fact  that  they  are  highly  vocal  it 

seems likely that these activities may be mediated by vocalizations (thus studies concerning 

the vocal activity describe the dolphins’ Wirkwelt because they investigate what the dolphins 

are doing). Furthermore, nighttime is the only time without human interaction for dolphins in 

captivity,  thus  presenting  a  particular  time  where  dolphins  might  express  more  behaviours 

relevant  to  their  internal  processes.  Therefore,  a  closer  investigation  of  dolphins’  vocal 

activity at night is necessary to  complete our knowledge about the dolphin’s  Umwelt. Here 

we asked: is there a nocturnal activity, measurable by vocal activity (Chapter 3, Paper 1)? 

With  respect  to  the  dolphins’  well-known  capacity  to  copy  sounds  from  their 

environment,  the  questions  remains  open  why  they  do  copy  a  certain  sounds  of  their 

environment but not another. It has been shown that dolphins produce vocal copies especially 

in the presence of a certain object that was associated with the original sound (Hooper et al. 

2006).  This  implies  that  these  objects  were  meaningful  to  the  dolphins.  This  led  to  the 

question  whether  the  production  of  vocal  copies  can  serve  as  an  indicator  for  the 

meaningfulness  of  the  original  sound  or  the  object/context  with  which  this  sound  was 

associated (Chapter 3, Paper 2). 

 

20 

Chapter 1: Introduction 

The  second  aspect  of  the  dolphin’s  Umwelt  concerns  the  perceptive  abilities  of 

different  modalities  (describing  the  dolphins’  Merkwelt,  i.e.  what  the  dolphins  are 

perceiving). As the literature review revealed, gustation, olfaction, and magnetoreception are 

mentioned  only  casually  although  they  are  potentially  functional  senses.  Therefore, 

information  is  lacking  about  their  possible  relevance  for  the  dolphin’s  perception  of  its 

Umwelt.  Dolphins  are  surrounded  by  a  huge  amount  of  chemical  information,  which  are 

known to be exploited by other marine species, thus we investigated their chemical senses. 

Because  food  preferences  have  been  reported  in  this  species,  we  were  wondering  whether 

those might be guided by taste (Chapter 4, Paper 3). Furthermore, prey location is mediated 

by olfactory cues in other marine species wherefore this raises the question whether dolphins 

are also able to perceive food-related odours (Chapter 4, Paper 4). 

Beside the five traditional senses (hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell), the perception 

of other cues can also provide useful information about the environment.  One of these less 

intensively  studied  senses  is  magnetoreception.  Although  some  spatial  observations  and 

anatomical  findings  suggest  that  dolphins  (and  other  cetaceans)  may  be  sensitive  to  the 

geomagnetic  field  (Kirschvink  et  al.  1986;  Klinowska  1985;  Walker  et  al.  1992), 

experimental evidence is lacking. Therefore we asked whether  dolphins possess a magnetic 

sense (Chapter 5, Paper 5).

STUDY SPECIES: SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

Common  bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  belong  to  the  odontocete  family 

Delphinidae that includes 35 species, ranging from the less than 1.5 m long Hector's dolphin 

(Cephalorhynchus hectori) to the 9 m long orca. Delphinids probably evolved 11-12 million 

years ago in the mid- to late Miocene and many of the early delphinid fossils can be assigned 

to extant genera, particularly to Tursiops (LeDuc 2009). The bottlenose dolphin is one of the 

best studied cetacean species, probably because of its frequent presence both at the coastline 

and  in  dolphinariums.  This  species  is  found  in  most  of  the  world’s  temperate  and  tropical 

seas, in coastal as well as offshore waters (Wells & Scott 2009). Coastal bottlenose dolphins 

often  are  long-term  resident  to  a  specific  home  area  (e.g.  Sarasota,  Florida;  Morey  Firth, 

Scotland; Shark Bay, Australia), meaning that the dolphins have a relatively permanent home 

range in a given area.  

Bottlenose dolphins live in a fission-fusion society meaning that individuals associate 

in  small  groups  that  frequently  change  in  composition  and  behaviour  (Connor  et  al.  2000). 

The  social  relationships  within  this  society  are  revealed  through  behaviours  expressed  in 

social  interactions,  repeated  over  days,  months  and  years  (Mann  et  al.  2000).  Affiliation 

between individuals is expressed by proximity, synchronous movements and physical contact 

(Connor et al. 2000). Another behaviour that often associates with affiliation is socio-sexual 

contact that may involve almost any age-sex class combination of individuals, and does not 

appear in exclusively affiliative or agonistic contexts (Connor et al. 2000).  

The development of social relationships seems to begin with long-term bonds between 

infants  who  spend  considerable  time  performing  social  play,  cultivating  important  social 

relationships  and  practicing  social  skills  (Connor  et  al.  2000).  Later  in  life  the  association 

patterns are different between females and males. Females have a large network of associates 

and within this extensive social web, most females associate most strongly with a subset of 

other  females  in  so-called  ‘bands’  (Connor  et  al.  2000).  Males  form  ‘first-order  alliances’ 

meaning  pairs  or  trios  that  cooperate  to  form  coercively  maintained  consortships  with 

individual females (Connor et al. 1992). Each pair or trio maintains associations with one or 

two  other  pairs  or  trios,  thus  forming  so-called  ‘second-order  alliances’  that  cooperate  in 

attempts  to  take  female  consorts  from  other  alliances  or  to  defend  against  such  attacks 

(Connor et al. 1992). 

 

25 

Chapter 2: Methodology 

Associations  between  males  and  females  are  tied  strongly  to  females’  reproductive 

state  (Connor  et  al.  2000).  In  Shark  Bay,  Australia,  mixed-sex-groups  are  common  and 

females and males were seen foraging together, engage in occasional affiliative contact and 

often travel and rest together (Smolker et al. 1992). There might exist a kind of ‘friendships’ 

between  males  and  females  (Connor  et  al.  2000).  Connor  et  al.  (1996)  reported  an 

observation in which one alliance appeared to prevent females from being herded or harassed 

by other males. 

Although births can occur all year round there are peaks in spring and summer months 

(Urian et al. 1996). Females give birth to usually one calf after a gestation period of about 12 

months (Perrin & Reilly 1984). Calves are weaned after a lactation period of 1.5 or 2 years 

but  stay  with  their  mothers  for  up  to  six  years  (Wells  &  Scott  2009).  In  general  sexual 

maturity  is  reached  by  females  at  5-13  years  and  by  males  at  9-14  years  (Wells  &  Scott 

2009). The life span of females is usually longer than that of males, who can reach an age of 

up to 48 years whereas females can live to more than 57 years (Wells & Scott 1999).  

2. 

STUDY SUBJECTS 

We  studied  a  group  of  captive-born  bottlenose  dolphins  in  the  facility  of  “Planète 

Sauvage” (Port-Saint-Père, France). The group consisted at any time of unrelated males and 

females at different ages (Table 1) but changed in composition over the course of the thesis. 

Two dolphins died (Thea, an adult female, and Mininos, a juvenile male) and three dolphins 

arrived from other facilities (Parel, a juvenile female, as well as Kite and Spat, two juvenile 

males).  Some  individuals  were  already  more  or  less  familiar  with  each  other  due  to  a 

common housing period prior to their arrival at “Planète Sauvage” (Figure 1). 

Individuals could be easily identified on the basis of physical differences. Appropriate 

for  identification  were  for  example  the  shape  of  the  dorsal  fin  or  fluke,  differences  in  the 

face, or colour patterns of the skin (Figure 2).

Chapter 2: Methodology 

The  four  pools  are  connected  by  channels  that  can  be  closed  with  gates  in  case  of  a 

necessary separation of a particular individual (e.g. birth or disease). In general, the channels 

are open during the day, thus the dolphins are free to use all pools. However, every now and 

then  the  trainers  closed  one  or  several  channels  for  some  time  in  order  to  habituate  the 

dolphins. 

Daily routine lasted from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. An exemplary day proceeded as follows (in 

summer, i.e. high season, there were up to four public shows per day whereas in winter the 

park is closed, thus there were no public shows but training sessions instead): 

–  8 a.m.: arrival of the first trainer; inspection of dolphins; preparation of fish 
–  9 a.m.: 1st session (feeding without training) 
–  10:30 a.m.: 2nd session (training and feeding) 
–  11:30 a.m.: 3rd session (training and feeding with public) 
–  2 p.m.: 4th session (public show) 
–  3:30 p.m.: 5th session (public show) 
–  5 p.m.: 6th session (training and feeding with public) 
–  6 p.m.: 7th session (feeding without training) 

–  7 p.m.: cleaning; inspection of dolphins; departure of last trainer 

Training sessions lasted ca. 15 minutes, public shows ca. 30 minutes. Training includes 

medical training (e.g. acceptance of inspection and palpation of all parts of the body or being 

touched  by  medical  equipment)  as  well  as  training  for  public  shows  (e.g.,  jump  on 

command). Shows started with a prelude: a soundtrack was broadcast from the loudspeakers 

of the dolphinarium, including music and natural sounds (i.e. sound of waves, sea gull calls, 

humpback whale calls, and dolphin whistles), and in the meantime the audience would enter 

the seating rows and take their places. After the prelude, the actual show started during which 

dolphins’  biology  and  behaviour  was  explained  to  the  public  (e.g.  demonstration  of  body 

features and physical  abilities;  explanation of threats  such as pollution or overfishing).  The 

shows were accompanied by music and a trainer commented the different activities. To avoid 

that  the  dolphins  become  bored  by  the  shows,  the  order  of  the  different  activities  was 

changed each time. All dolphins were trained from an early age using positive reinforcement 

(operant conditioning) with fish as primary reinforcer.

Chapter 2: Methodology 

The diet of the dolphins was primarily composed of frozen stored fish (herring, capelin, 

sprat,  mackerel,  and  whiting)  and  squid,  whose  quality  is  controlled  regularly  through 

biochemical analyses conducted by an external laboratory. The species composition changed 

on a daily basis but contained at least three different fish species each day. A daily ration of 

5-10  kg  per  individual  (depending  on  its  size)  was  given  throughout  the  day  during  the 

training/feeding sessions. 

Free time between the training sessions was enriched from time to time with toys (e.g. 

foam mat, ball) and water jets, however, dolphins were free to do what they liked. 

 

 

 

4.  DATA COLLECTION 

Four  studies  have  been  conducted  in  order  to  investigate  different  sensory  modalities 

and thereby to contribute to fill in the gaps of knowledge about dolphins’ perception of their 

Umwelt. With the exception of the acoustic recordings, all data were collected as part of this 

thesis. The general approach of these studies is based on the spontaneaous responses of the 

dolphins, meaning that the dolphins were never trained to respond in a certain way to a given 

stimulus.  Contrarily  to  most  other  studies  no  operant  conditioning  was  used  (e.g.  go/no-go 

paradigm).  With  respect  to  the  Umwelt  concept,  this  approach  offers  the  advantageous 

opportunity to study spontaneaous responses based on internal processes that can potentially 

reflect the significance a given stimulus may have for an individual. 

4.1.  Acoustic Recordings 

The  acoustic  behaviour  of  the  dolphins  in  Planète  Sauvage  has  been  already 

investigated  in  a  previous  study  (Briseño  Jaramillo  2009).  Over  seven  month,  the 

dolphins have been recorded in different situations as well as at different times. A part 

of  those  recordings,  that  have  been  made  during  eight  nights  (between  18:00  and 

06:00)  in  April  and  May  2009  and  have  not  been  investigated  before,  served  as  data 

basis for the here presented findings. 

To  semi-continuously  record  the  dolphins’  vocalizations  two  Nauta  SS03-10 

hydrophones  were  placed  at  opposite  sides  of  pool  1.  They  were  connected  to  a 

Marantz  PMD  670  recorder  (sample  rate:  44.1  kHz;  resolution:  16  bit;  frequency 

 

32 

Chapter 2: Methodology 

response:  15-20000  Hz  ±  3dB)  that  in  turn  was  connected  to  a  Dell  390  computer 

where  the  sounds  were  recorded  by  using  ANA  software  (Richard  et  al.  1991). 

Recording sessions lasted between 60 to 80 minutes, after what the batteries needed to 

be changed, leading to several sessions per night. 

At  the  same  time  of  the  acoustic  recordings,  a  human  observer  was  positioned 

next to pool 1 and counted the number of respirations. Although visual restrictions at 

night did not allow identification, blows were well audible and therefore easy to count. 

However, light conditions prevented the collection of other behavioural data. 

The  main  challenge  of  the  investigation  of  chemoreception  in  dolphins  was  the 

lack  of  previous  studies  that  could  have  served  as  a  guideline  regarding  the 

experimental  design  or  the  behaviours  to  look  at.  Therefore,  we  needed  to  creatively 

 

4.2.  Chemoreception 

invent new techniques.  

 
4.2.1. Sense of Taste 

The study on gustation was conducted in collaboration with Benoist Schaal 

(Centre des Sciences du Goût, CNRS (UMR 6265), Université de Bourgogne). In 

January and February 2012, we tested the dolphins’ capacity to perceive flavours. 

Ice cubes present a suitable matrix for presenting flavours because they are easy 

to  produce  with  different  flavours  while  being  visually  and  tactically  identical. 

Furthermore, the dolphins  expressed a high liking for them. Sometimes  trainers 

gave ice cubes as enrichment to the dolphins after training or feeding where ice 

cubes are used to meanwhile cool the fish in a metal bowl. The use of ice cubes 

as  enrichment  is  not  uncommon  in  the  husbandry  of  aquatic  species  (Warne-

Reese 1997). Thus, ice cubes were familiar to all dolphins and no habituation was 

necessary.  Ice  cubes  were  produced  with  herring,  salmon,  and  shrimp  flavours, 

originally used for human cooking or for baiting fish. Each flavour was diluted in 

water with which the experimental ice cubes were produced. In order to create ice 

cubes whose flavour was as close as possible to the original flavour (of herring, 

salmon,  and  shrimp),  different  concentrations  were  tasted  by  the  experimenter 

until the best, i.e. neither excessively intense nor lacking flavour, was found.

4.2.2. Sense of Smell 

The  study  on  olfaction  was  conducted  in  collaboration  with  Aurélie 

Célérier  and  Silvia  Campagna  (Centre  d’écologie  fonctionnelle  et  évolutive, 

CNRS  (UMR  5175),  Université  de  Montpellier).  In  May  and  June  2013,  we 

tested the dolphins’ capacity to perceive an odour. Therefore, fish was placed in 

an opaque plastic barrel that was placed next to pool 3 and attached to a pole of a 

connecting  channel  (either  pool  3/pool  1  or  pool  3/pool  2)  to  prevent  it  from 

falling  in  the  pool.  Simultaneously,  an  identical  but  empty  barrel  was  placed  at 

the other position and served as control (Figure 4). The position for fish/control 

barrel  changed randomly and  the dolphins were filmed  (Sony Handycam  HDR-

XR 155 on a tripod) to avoid interaction with and influence of the experimenter.

4.3.  Magnetoreception 

In  January  and  February  2013,  we  tested  the  dolphins’  capacity  to  perceive  a 

magnetic field in pool 4. For this experiment we used the same plastic barrels as in the 

experiment  “sense  of  taste”.  Inside,  a  magnetic  neodymium  block  was  placed.  The 

barrel  was  attached  to  a  wooden  plank  that  was placed  at  the  border  of  the  pool  in  a 

way that the barrel hung in the water (Figure 5). The same device served as control but 

with  a  demagnetized  neodymium  block  inside.  This  control  block  had  the  same 

dimensions  and  same  density  as  the  magnetized  one,  therefore  the  dolphins  could 

probably  not  discriminate  the  two  stimuli  by  echolocation  (no  information  were 

available whether or not a magnetic field influences the properties of the echolocation 

signal but it seems unlikely). The device was always installed by a person blind to the 

content  of  the  barrel,  i.e.  either  the  magnetic  or  the  demagnetized  neodymium  block 

that  were  presented  in  a  randomized  order.  The  sessions  were  filmed  with  a  video 

camera (Sony Handycam HDR-XR 155) on a tripod.

5.  DATA ANALYSIS 

We  used  different  parametric  and  non-parametric  statistical  tests  to  analyse  the  data 

obtained during the experiments. With the exception of the acoustic recordings, all data were 

available  at  the  individual  level.  Statistic  calculations  were  done  using  R  software  (version 

2.15.0, R Development Core Team, www.r-project.org). 

 

5.1.  Acoustic Recordings 

Because  the  identity  of  the  vocalizing  dolphin  was  not  available,  data  were 

available only at the group level. For temporal analyses, we divided the night by two-

hour-intervals, leading to six time periods (i.e., 18:00-20:00, 20:00-22:00, 22:00-00:00, 

00:00-02:00, 02:00-04:00, and 04:00-06:00). 

First,  whistles  were  visually  classified  into  whistle  categories  following  current 

bioacoustics  methods  (Adret-Hausberger  1989;  Azevedo  et  al.  2007;  Bazúa-Duran  & 

Au 2002; Díaz López 2011; Lemasson & Hausberger 2011) and the number of whistles 

per  time  period  was  counted  to  determine  the  whistle  rate  of  each  whistle  category. 

Whistle  rates  were  compared  between  time  periods  (Chi²-tests)  and  between  whistle 

categories  (GLM)  but  also  between  whistle  categories  for  each  time  period  and  vice 

versa  (G-tests).  Then,  we  investigated  the  temporal  organization  of  vocal  sequences, 

i.e.  a  series  of  consecutive  whistles  of  the  same  whistle  type  by  means  of  whistle 

repeatability  (indicated  by  a  whistle  sequence  index,  WSI)  and  the  inter-whistle-

interval  (IWI).  WSI  and  IWI  were  compared  between  time  periods  across  whistle 

categories. For WSI, a non-parametric G-test was used, whereas data on IWI allowed a 

parametric GLM. 

During  the  analysis  of  the  acoustic  recordings,  we  found  not  only  whistles  but 

also  some  unusual  sounds  that  have  never  been  recorded  previously  from  these 

dolphins.  To evaluate the first  impression that these unusual  vocalizations  were more 

similar to the whale calls broadcast during the daily public shows than to the dolphins’ 

own whistles, we used a discriminant function analysis on several measured frequency 

and  time  parameters.  To  go  further,  a  playback  experiment  with  human  subjects  was 

conducted and the resulting assignment of sounds (dolphin or whale) was compared by 

using Wilcoxon tests.

5.2.  Chemoreception 

5.2.1. Sense of Taste 

 Previous  studies  on  dolphins’  sense  of  taste  investigated  their  detection 

thresholds by using the go/no-go paradigm (Friedl et al. 1990; Kuznetzov, 1990; 

Nachtigall & Hall 1984) and therefore no information on dolphins’ spontaneous 

responses towards tastes was available. From preliminary observations we knew 

that  dolphins  sometimes  stayed  close  to  the  experimenter  but  sometimes  swam 

away and were therefore out of sight. That is why the latency to come back and 

beg for another ice cube was  chosen as  measure  of the dolphin’s  interest in  the 

previous  ice  cube  flavour.  We  compared  begging  latencies  between  different 

flavours (LMM) considering the individual’s identity as random factor. 

 

5.2.2.  Sense of Smell 

 As no previous studies on dolphins’ sense of smell were available, we had 

no information  on how a dolphin’s  reaction towards an odorous  stimulus  might 

look  like.  In  general,  however,  breathing  patterns  affect  the  perception  of 

odourants  (Saslow  2002).  Therefore  we  chose  to  simply  take  the  number  of 

respiration within  a range  of approximately  2.5  m  around the barrels where the 

smell  would  be  possibly  detectable  as  a  measure  to  investigate  whether  or  not 

dolphins  could  perceive  the  odour.  We  compared  the  number  of  respirations 

between fish and control by using Wilcoxon tests.  

 

5.3.  Magnetoreception 

Videos were analysed by an observer who was blind to the content of the barrel 

visible in the video. Different behaviours of the dolphins that occurred within a range 

of 1.5 m around the barrel  were investigated. Therefore, we overlaid the video image 

with  a  border  that  marked  this  range.  To  create  this  border,  we  installed  the  device 

together with the tripod and the video camera once before the experiment started, and 

asked a trainer in the water to hold a measuring tape of 1.5 m. Whereas the other end of 

the  measuring  tape  was  at  the  barrel  (hold  by  another  person),  the  trainer  removed 

herself  from  the  device  until  the  measuring  tape  was  fully  stretched  out.  At  this 

 

37 

Chapter 2: Methodology 

moment we took a picture with the video camera. This procedure was repeated several 

times in order to cover all sides of the barrel. Afterwards, the pictures were matched on 

the computer and the different measurement points were connected to create the border 

(Figure  6).  Using  one  border  for  all  experimental  videos  was  possible,  because  the 

device and the tripod with the video camera were always installed in exactly the same 

way, therefore ensuring that the pictures filmed with the camera were always the same 

(i.e.  the  wooden  plank  reaching  into  the  picture  from  the  lower  right  corner  with  the 

same distances each time; Figure 6). 

 

 

Figure  6:  Screen  shot  from  a  video  recorded  during  an  experimental  session  of  the  experiment 
“magnetorecepotion”. The black border was added in the picture to visualize the range of 1.5 m around 
the barrel within which the behaviours were measured. The circle marks the position of the barrel’s lid 
when it hangs from the  wooden plank without being touched (here, the two dolphins have  touched the 
barrel, therefore  it  moved and the  lid is no longer at its original position). The  five  lines represent the 
five distance measurements that were performed to create the 1.5 m-area’s border.  

 

The  behaviours  measured  were:  the  latency  for  the  first  approach  (i.e.  entering 

the 1.5 m range around the device), the time spent within this area, the latencies for the 

first rostrum contact and the first body contact (i.e. contact with the device by another 

part of the body than the rostrum), as well as the number and duration of rostrum and 

body contacts. We compared all variables between magnet and control (Wilcoxon).

6.  CONSTRAINTS 

In general, working in a zoo offers several advantages such as continuous presence of 

the  animals;  however,  there  are  also  some  constraints.  Experiments  can  only  take  place 

between trainings and shows. Especially during the high season in summer, time schedules 

for experiments were restricted because the number of shows per day increased. On the other 

hand, winter is often the only time when necessary maintenance work on the facilities can be 

realised.  Therefore,  even  in  months  without  public  shows,  the  possibility  to  conduct 

experiments  was  sometimes  very  limited.  Highly  complex  facilities  such  as  dolphinariums 

can be liable to technical problems, be it the filtration or something else. In the course of this 

thesis, some unforeseen technical problems occurred, thus obstructed, interrupted or stopped 

some experiments. 

But  also  the  dolphins  themselves,  as  any  other  study  species,  can  cause  some 

complication. The most extensive impairment was their sexual activity that peaks in spring. 

In  these  times,  all  dolphins  were  highly  engaged  in  sexual  and  social  behaviours  and  were 

absolutely not  responsive to  anything  else than another dolphin. Thus, the dolphins  did  not 

participate well (often not at all) neither in trainings or shows nor in experiments, meaning 

that the dolphins would not react to a trainer’s command, a toy, or an experimental device.  

In  the  particular  case  of  this  thesis  another  unexpected  incidence  occurred:  two 

dolphins died due to illness, leaving the group each time socially unstable for a certain time 

afterwards.

SUMMARY OF PAPER 1 

Questions: From the human point of view, the Umwelt differs between day and night due to 
a circadian activity rhythm,  i.e. in  general  being  awake during the day  and sleeping during 
the night. Cetaceans are known to have a different type of sleep (unihemispheric in contrast 
to  bihemispheric  sleep),  wherefore  their  activity  rhythm  is  not  as  strictly  committed  to  the 
same  diurnal-nocturnal  alternation.  Still,  nighttime  is  a  particular  period  (darkness,  quiet). 
However,  little  is  known  about  the  nocturnal  Umwelt  of  dolphins.  Is  there  a  nocturnal 
activity, measurable by vocal activity? 

Methods:  We  investigated  the  nocturnal  whistle  rate  of  the  Planète  Sauvage  bottlenose 
dolphins.  In  addition,  respiration  rate  served  as  indicator  of  physical  activity  as  sleep  in 
dolphins is, among others, characterized by low respiration rates.  

Results: We found that the dolphins’ vocal production followed a temporal pattern with two 
peaks  of  intense  whistle  activity  (8  p.m.  and  midnight),  which  were  followed  by  a  strong 
decrease and low respiration rates, resembling the pre-sleep chorusing in other species. 

Conclusions:  Bottlenose  dolphins’  nightly  activity  pattern  suggests  that  active  phases 
alternate  with  more  quiet  phases.  Although  resting/sleeping  probably  occurs,  their  vocal 
activity  indicates  a  more  complex  activity  rhythm  compared  to  simply  diurnal/nocturnal 
rhythm, likely due to the unihemispheric sleep. Thus, the nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins can 
be considered richer than expected.   

This  paper  is  under  review  in  Animal  Behavior  and  Cognition  and  has  been  presented  in 
parts  at  the  2013  International  Ethological  Conference  &  the  Association  for  the  Study  of 
Animal Behaviour (IEC 2013).

Abstract 

Diurnal animals also produce sounds at night. In several roosting species, high vocal activity 
at the roosting site seems to be a prerequisite to sleep, suggesting a role of vocal chorusing in 
coordinating  resting  activities.  Dolphins’  nocturnal  vocal  activity  has  been  rarely 
investigated. However, this animal model is interesting because: dolphin resting behaviour is 
associated with social synchrony (swimming in tight formations and synchronous breathing) 
and dolphins’ daily social activities are primarily mediated by vocal interactions. Therefore, 
we recorded the nocturnal vocal and breathing activities of a captive group of five bottlenose 
dolphins.  The  temporal  pattern  revealed  two  peaks  of  intense  whistle  activity  (8  p.m.  and 
midnight), which were followed by a strong decrease  and low respiration rates, resembling 
the  pre-sleep  chorusing  in  other  species.  These  findings  are  questioning  the  significance  of 
nocturnal  vocal  activity  in  marine mammals.  Contrarily to  earlier reports on wild  dolphins, 
these productions are clearly outside a nocturnal feeding context. They shed new light on the 
potential cognitive and social significance of auditory communication in this poorly known 
resting context.

1. 

INTRODUCTION 

Dawn  and  dusk  chorusing  have  been  commonly  described  in  a  variety  of  songbirds 

(Burt  & Vehrencamp 2005) and primates (Schel & Zuberbühler 2012). Different functional 

hypotheses  have  been  proposed:  inter-group  spacing  (Geissmann  &  Mutschler  2006),  mate 

assessment  or  attraction  (Galdikas  1983),  adaption  to  sound  propagation  constraints 

(Henwood & Fabrick 1979), and intra-group coordination (Boinski & Campbell 1995). The 

phenomenon is especially striking in roosting species of birds or bats, where vocal activity at 

roosting sites is very intense and seems to be a prerequisite to sleep (Adret-Hausberger 1982; 

Kunz 1982). After that, sleeping birds and bats remain silent unless some disturbance occurs 

when  a  new  (smaller)  peak  of  vocal  activity  can  be  observed  before  resuming  resting 

behaviour and silence (Adret-Hausberger 1982; Kunz 1982). Similar observations have been 

made in sleeping clusters of Barbary macaques (Ansorge et al. 1992). Vocal activity resumes 

again  before  emergence  from  roosts,  e.g.  about  two  hours  before,  in  bats  (Kunz  1982).  In 

European  starlings,  peaks  of  vocal  activity  arise  before  each  wave  of  departure  of  a  bird 

group,  suggesting  a  role  of  vocalization  in  synchronizing  and  coordinating  departures  of 

social  groups  (Adret-Hausberger  1982;  Feare  1984;  Hausberger  et  al.  2008).  Vocal  signals 

have  also  been  shown  to  be  involved  in  synchronizing  flight  departures  in  whooper  and 

Bewick’s swans  (Black  1988) or troop movements  in  Campbell’s monkeys (Ouattara et al. 

2009)  and  howler  monkeys  (Milton  1980).  One  possible  primary  function  proposed  for 

nocturnal chorusing has indeed been interactive communication and social coordination (Burt 

& Vehrencamp 2005; Staicer et al. 1996). 

Sleeping clusters in primates as well as nocturnal roosting in birds and bats rely upon 

social synchrony (Adret-Hausberger 1982; Ansorge et al. 1992; Feare 1984; Hammerschmidt 

et al. 1994; Hausberger et al. 2008; Kunz 1982). Young Barbary macaques show distress if 

they are not included in a sleeping cluster (Ansorge et al. 1992; Hammerschmidt et al. 1994). 

In European starlings, songs seem to help the birds to remain in vicinity of socially related 

conspecifics (Hausberger et al. 2008). Although little is still known on sleeping behaviour of 

cetaceans (Lyamin et al. 2008), resting/sleeping behaviour was found to account for 87% of 

total  time  at  night  in  captive  bottlenose  dolphins  (Sekiguchi  &  Kohshima  2003)  and  is 

associated  with  social  synchrony  during  so-called  swim-rest,  involving  two  or  more 

individuals  (Gnone  et  al.  2001;  Sekiguchi  &  Kohshima  2003).  Wild  dolphins  also  show 

 

45 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

resting  in  tight  formations  (“carpet  formation”;  Würsig  et  al.  1994),  and  this  synchronous 

swimming is performed with often one eye open on the nearest neighbor’s side (Goley 1999). 

At that stage, dolphins are silent (Gnone et al. 2001; Sekiguchi & Kohshima 2003). 

Data  on  diel  patterns  of  vocalizations  in  cetaceans  are  variable.  Captive  bottlenose 

dolphins tend to produce more vocalizations at daytime (Moore & Ridgway 1996; Therrien 

et  al.  2012),  whereas  other  cetacean  species  were  found  to  be  vocally  more  active  at 

nighttime in the wild (Munger et al. 2008; Stafford et al., 2012). Several authors assumed an 

association  between  nocturnal  foraging  and  vocal  activity  in  dolphins  (Goold  2000; 

Notarbartolo  di  Sciara  &  Gordon  1997).  Indeed,  bottlenose  dolphins  increase  whistle  rate 

during  day  feeding  events,  probably  to  recruit  other  individuals  (Acevedo-Gutiérrez  & 

Stienessen 2004). However, choruses outside feeding periods have been described at night in 

humpback whales (Au et al. 2000) as well as at sunrise in bottlenose dolphins (Powell 1966). 

Overall,  increased  whistle  production  has  been  associated  with  increased  group  excitement 

(Díaz López & Shirai 2009; dos Santos et al. 2005) and socializing (Jones & Sayigh 2002; 

Quick  &  Janik  2008).  In  the  wild,  solitary  animals  do  not  seem  to  produce  whistles  (Díaz 

López & Shirai 2009).  

In the present study, we hypothesized that resting behaviour in bottlenose dolphins, as 

it involves social synchrony (Gnone et al. 2001; Sekiguchi & Kohshima 2003; Würsig et al. 

1994), may be preceded by increased vocal activity, possibly reflecting as in roosting birds 

and bats the excitement preceding resting/sleeping. In order to test this hypothesis, the vocal 

and respiratory activity of a group of captive bottlenose dolphins was recorded all night long. 

 

2.  MATERIAL & METHODS 

2.1.  Subjects and housing conditions 

We studied three male (5, 10, and 25 years old) and two female (8 and 17 years 

old)  captive-born  bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  in  the  facility  of  Planète 

Sauvage  (Port-Saint-Père,  France).  Before  they  were  brought  together  in  Planète 

Sauvage  in  December  2008,  the  males  and  the  females  respectively  lived  together  in 

other delphinariums.  Overall, this  outdoor facility  covers over 2000 m²  water surface 

and  contains  7500000  l  salt  water  cleaned  with  ozone.  The  diet  of  the  dolphins  was 

primarily composed of fish (herring, capelin, sprat, mackerel, and whiting) and squid. 

 

46 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

The daily ration of 5-10 kg per individual (depending on its size) was given throughout 

the  day  (between  9  a.m.  and  5  p.m.)  during  nine  training  and  feeding  sessions 

conducted by the dolphin trainers. Sessions includes medical training (e.g., acceptance 

of inspection and palpation) as well as training for public presentations (e.g., jump on 

command). 

2.2.  Data collection 

We observed the dolphins at different times, between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., during 

eight  nights  in  April  and  May  2009  (22  hours  in  total).  Observation  sessions  lasted 

about one hour each, were repeated 2 to 5 times per night, and were distributed over the 

different nights in order to cover all night hours. During observations, a Nauta SS03-10 

hydrophone  was  connected  to  a  Marantz  PMD  670  recorder  (sample  rate:  44.1  kHz; 

resolution: 16 bit; frequency response: 15-20000 Hz ± 3dB) to record the vocalizations. 

In  order  to  assess  in  parallel  the  physical  activity  of  the  animals,  a  human  observer 

(M.B.J.),  positioned  next  to  the  pool,  counted  the  number  of  respirations.  Although 

visual restrictions at night did not allow observation or identification, blows were well 

audible  and  therefore  useful  for  data  collection.  For  subsequent  analyses,  data  were 

pooled in six “time periods” lasting two hours  (i.e., 6-8, 8-10, and 10-12 p.m., 0-2, 2-4, 

and  4-6  a.m.),  leading  to  2  to  6  repetitions  (recording  at  different  nights)  per  time 

period,  with  an  average  recording  duration  of  221  ±  89  minutes  per  time  period  (for 

details see Table 1).

2.3.  Data analysis 

2.3.1. Whistle classification 

As we did not have access to callers’ identity it was not possible to analyse 

signature whistles (Caldwell & Caldwell 1965) as it is often done (reviewed by 

Janik & Sayigh 2013). Moreover, our past investigations at day time confirmed 

that many whistle types were shared among group members as it is often found in 

captivity (McCowan & Reiss 1995). Indeed, signature whistles are reported to be 

often not produced at all in captivity (Janik & Slater 1998). Therefore we used a 

more  global  classification  method  not  considering  single  whistle  types  but 

broader  whistle  categories  to  address  the  comprehensive  structure  of  vocal 

activity.  

Whistles were classified into whistle categories  according to their number 

of inflection points and the orientation of their frequency modulation (Azevedo et 

al.  2007;  Bazúa-Duran  &  Au  2002;  Díaz  López  2011).  The  definition  for  an 

inflection point was adopted from Pivari and Rosso (2005): a change in the slope 

of the whistle contour from negative to positive, or vice versa. This classification, 

also  used  in  classical  bioacoustic  research  (e.g.  Adret-Hausberger  1989; 

Lemasson & Hausberger 2011), led to seven whistle categories (Figure 1). 

 

2.3.2. Whistle and respiration rate 

Whistle  and  respiration  rates  were  counted  for  each  night  time  period: 

number of whistles per 120 minutes (“whistle rate”) and number of respirations 

per  120  minutes  (“respiration  rate”).  In  a  comparative  perspective,  we  also 

calculated the day whistle rate from recordings made in the same facility with the 

same  group  and  the  same  equipment  (performed  during  4  days  in  March  2009 

between 10 a.m.  and 5  p.m.; 16 recording sessions  with  a total  duration of 220 

minutes). We considered the obtained day rate (19.64 whistles per 120 minutes) 

as  a  baseline  rate,  since  it  was  comparable  with  the  whistle  rate  reported  in 

another study in a same-size group of captive bottlenose dolphins (13.62 whistles 

per 120 minutes; Therrien et al. 2012).

During day and night recordings group condition was calm, i.e., individuals 

were together as a group and had been in the facility for more than three months. 

Recordings were never performed during training sessions or public presentation.

2.3.3. Acoustic and temporal organization of vocal sequences 

Whistles  were  often  emitted  in  sequences,  i.e.  a  series  of  consecutive 

whistles  of  the  same  whistle  type.  To  describe  the  proportion  of  whistle 

sequences  within  a  given  recording,  we  calculated  a  whistle  sequence  index 

(WSI) as follows: 

(cid:2898)(cid:2931)(cid:2923)(cid:2912)(cid:2915)(cid:2928)(cid:3)(cid:2925)(cid:2916)(cid:3)(cid:2926)(cid:2911)(cid:2919)(cid:2928)(cid:2929)(cid:3)(cid:2933)(cid:2919)(cid:2930)(cid:2918)(cid:3)(cid:2930)(cid:2933)(cid:2925)(cid:3)(cid:2913)(cid:2925)(cid:2924)(cid:2929)(cid:2915)(cid:2913)(cid:2931)(cid:2930)(cid:2919)(cid:2932)(cid:2915)(cid:3)(cid:2933)(cid:2918)(cid:2919)(cid:2929)(cid:2930)(cid:2922)(cid:2915)(cid:2929)(cid:3)(cid:2925)(cid:2916)(cid:3)(cid:2930)(cid:2918)(cid:2915)(cid:3)(cid:2929)(cid:2911)(cid:2923)(cid:2915)(cid:3)(cid:2913)(cid:2911)(cid:2930)(cid:2915)(cid:2917)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2935)
 

(cid:2904)(cid:2925)(cid:2930)(cid:2911)(cid:2922)(cid:3)(cid:2924)(cid:2931)(cid:2923)(cid:2912)(cid:2915)(cid:2928)(cid:3)(cid:2925)(cid:2916)(cid:3)(cid:2933)(cid:2918)(cid:2919)(cid:2929)(cid:2930)(cid:2922)(cid:2915)(cid:3)(cid:2926)(cid:2911)(cid:2919)(cid:2928)(cid:2929)

 * 100 

WSI ranges from 100, meaning that all whistles are of the same category, to 

0,  meaning  that  no  whistle  is  followed  by  a  whistle  of  the  same  category. 

Repetitions  can  result  from  a  single  individual  repeating  a  certain  whistle 

category  or  from  a  vocal  interaction  between  individuals.  Inter-whistle-interval 

(IWI)  can  give  some  indication  of  the  character  of  these  repetitions:  bottlenose 

dolphins’ IWI was reported to be between 1-10 seconds when single individuals 

repeat a certain whistle category (Janik et al. 2013), but mostly less than 3 second 

during vocal interactions (Janik 2000). Therefore, IWI, i.e., the time between the 

end  of  a  whistle  and  the  start  of  the  following  whistle,  was  measured  to  assess 

potential vocal interaction activity. We did not determine a maximum IWI above 

which two whistles were no anymore considered as a pair but included all whistle 

 

 

All  statistic  calculations  were  done  using  R  software  (version  2.15.0,  R 

pairs in this analysis.

2.4.1. Whistle and respiration rate 

Whistle and respiration rates were compared using Chi²-tests,  which were 

also used for pairwise comparisons (correction:  False Discovery Rate (FDR); R 

package:  RVAideMemoire).  Whistle  rate  was  compared  between  whistle 

categories  by  using  a  likelihood  ratio  test  on  an  additive  Generalized  Linear 

Model  (GLM),  with  a  Poisson  family.  Pairwise  comparisons  were  performed 

 

50 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

with the contrasts method (correction: False Discovery Rate (FDR); R package: 

doBy). To go further, whistle rate was compared between whistle categories for 

each  time  period  by  using  a  G-test.  When  needed,  pairwise  comparisons  were 

performed by using multiple G-tests (correction: FDR). The same procedure was 

used to compare whistle rate depending on time period for each whistle category. 

Overall  whistle  rate  was  compared  between  night  and  day  using  Chi²-test. 

Spearman’s  rank  correlation  evaluated  a  possible  relationship  between  whistle 

and respiration rates.  

 

2.4.2. Acoustic and temporal organization of vocal sequences 

WSI  was  compared  between  time  periods  by  using  a  G-test,  followed  by 

pairwise  comparisons  (correction:  FDR).  IWI  was  compared  between  time 

periods  by  using  a  GLM  with  a  negative  binomial  law  (R  package:  MASS), 

followed by pairwise comparisons with the contrasts method (correction: FDR). 

Spearman’s rank correlation evaluated a possible relationship between WSI and 

IWI.  Overall  WSI,  average  IWI,  and  average  sequence  length  were  compared 

between night and day using Chi²-tests.  

 

3.  RESULTS 

3.1.  Whistle and respiration rate 

During observations, a total of 484 whistles were recorded. Vocal activity varied 

significantly in the course of the night (Figure 2). Whistles rate was significantly higher 

than expected at 8-10 p.m. and 0-2 a.m. (N = 6; 34.89 ≥ χ² ≥ 30.98, p < 0.001), whereas 

it  was  lower  than  expected  at  6-8  and  10-12  p.m.  and  2-4  and  4-6  a.m.  (N  =  6; 

5.16 ≤ χ² ≤ 20.13, p ≤  0.023). Highest  whistle rate (76 whistles per 120  minutes) was 

recorded  at  8-10  p.m.  and  was  around  five  times  higher  than  at  2-4  a.m.,  when  we 

recorded  the  lowest  whistle  rate  (15  whistles  per  120  minutes).  Overall,  whistle  rate 

was  significantly  higher  at  night  (43.21  whistles  per  120  minutes)  compared  to  day 

whistle  rate  (19.64  whistles  per  120  minutes;  χ²  =  8.83,  p  =  0.003).  Respiration  rate 

presented  a  different  pattern,  globally  decreasing  from  6-8  p.m.  (763  respirations  per 

120 minutes, i.e. 1.27 respirations/minute/individual) to 4-6 a.m. (574 respirations per 

 

51 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

120 minutes, i.e. 0.96 respirations/minute/individual; Figure 2). At 6-8 and 8-10 p.m., 

respiration rate was significantly higher than expected (18.30 ≥ χ² ≥ 7.08, p ≤ 0.016), 

whereas  it  was  lower  than  expected  at  4-6  a.m.  (χ²  =  14.19,  p  <  0.001).  Whistle  and 

respiration rates were not  correlated  (Spearman’s rank  correlation: N  = 6; rs = 0.696, 

p = 0.125),  however,  the  lowest  respiration  rates  were  observed  just  after  the  highest 

whistles rates. 

 

 

Figure  2:  Changes  in  whistle  and  respiration  rates  in  the  course  of  the  night.  Whistle  and  respiration 
rates (i.e. number of whistles and respirations, respectively, per 120 minutes) are illustrated with black 
bars  and  white  circles,  respectively.  Plus-  and  minus-signs  indicate  that  the  observed  rates  are 
significantly  higher  or  lower,  respectively,  than  expected  (Chi²-tests;  alpha  =  0.05).  Mean  day  whistle 
rate is illustrated as a baseline (grey dashed line). 

 

Whistle rate differed according to whistle category (likelihood ratio test: N = 42; 

χ²  =  131.40).  Overall,  regardless  of  night  time  period,  “multilooped”  whistles  were 

preferentially emitted (p ≤ 0.025), followed by “rising” whistles (p ≤ 0.006), whereas 

“wave” whistles had lowest  whistle rate (p ≤  0.005).  Likewise, at  day,  “multilooped” 

and  “rising”  whistles  had  highest  whistles  rates  and  accounted  for  80.56%  of  all 

whistles  recorded  during  the  day  reference  period.  Considering  both  whistle  category 

and night time period, either were found to affect whistle rate (G-test; whistle category: 

N = 7, G = 19.40; time period: N = 6, G = 2.47; Figure 3). Three whistle categories did 

not differ statistically in whistle rate between time periods, meaning their whistle rates 

were  consistent  in  the  course  of  the  night  (“flat”:  G  =  2.52,  p  =  0.773;  “wave”: 

 

52 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

G = 6.74,  p  =  0.240;  “sine”:  G  =  7.69,  p  =  0.174).  Whistle  rates  of  all  other  whistle 

categories  (“rising”,  “descending”,  “U-shape”,  “multilooped”)  differed  according  to 

time  period  (40.08  ≥  G  ≥  17.43,  0.004  ≥  p  ≥  0.001).  The  relative  frequency  of 

occurrence of the different whistle categories differed according to time period. Thus, 

dolphins  produced  mostly  “multilooped”  whistles  during  the  first  peak  at  8-10  p.m. 

(52.6%; G = 74.09, p < 0.001) and “rising” whistles during the second peak at 0-2 a.m. 

(32.9%; G = 27.45, p ≤ 0.006).

colour, the higher the whistle rate (number of whistles per 120 minutes). 

 

3.2.  Acoustic and temporal organization of vocal sequences 

At night, almost half (48.5%) of the recorded whistles occurred in sequences, i.e., 

at  least  two  consecutive  whistles  of  the  same  category  (227  pairs  of  whistles  of  the 

same  category  out  of  468  whistle  pairs  in  total),  whereas  at  day  it  accounts  for  more 

than three quarters (76.47%).  In total, we found 79 whistle sequences at night and 5 at 

 

53 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

day.  The  longest  sequences  were  repetitions  of  “multilooped”  whistles  (at  night: 

comprising 37 whistles; at day: comprising 15 whistles), the average whistle sequence 

length  was  3.9  whistles  at  night  and  6.2  whistles  at  day  (difference  not  significant: 

χ² = 0.52, p = 0.469).  

Whistle  repeatability  (indicated  by  WSI)  was  below  the  day  baseline  of  76.47 

(χ² = 6.26,  p  =  0.012).  Furthermore,  WSI  differed  significantly  between  night  time 

periods (G-test: N = 6; G = 21.91, p < 0.001; Figure 4), reaching its maximum at 8-10 

p.m. (WSI = 0.64), the time period when whistle rate was highest. Whistles of the same 

category  were  repeated  more  often  in  early  evening  (6-8  and  8-10  p.m.)  and  early 

morning (4-6 a.m.) compared to the middle of the night (p ≤ 0.018). 

Nocturnal  inter-whistle-interval  (IWI)  was  above  the  day  baseline  of  16.12  sec 

(χ² = 18.90, p < 0.001). IWI was around four times higher at 2-4 a.m. compared to all 

other night time periods (GLM: N = 471; χ² = 60.41, p ≤ 0.002; Figure 4). This time 

period  is  coincident  with  the  time  period  when  whistle  rate  was  lowest.  Overall, 

whistles  occurring  in  sequence  (intra-sequence  whistles)  were  separated  by  shorter 

IWIs compared to whistles not occurring in sequence (non-sequence whistles), but both 

followed  the  same  course  (i.e.,  clearly  peaking  at  0-2  a.m.).  WSI  and  IWI  were  not 

correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation: N = 6; rS = 0.143, p = 0.803).

sequence  index  (WSI)  and  inter-whistle-interval  (IWI)  are  illustrated  with  black  circles  and  white 
squares,  respectively.  Same  letters  indicate  absence  of  statistical  difference  between  two  given  time 
periods  (WSI:  G-test;  IWI:  GLM;  alpha  =  0.05).  Mean  day  WSI  and  IWI  are  illustrated  as  baselines 
(grey dashed and dotted line, respectively).

4.  DISCUSSION 

Nocturnal  underwater  acoustic  recordings  of  a  group  of  captive  bottlenose  dolphins 

revealed a temporal pattern with two peaks, one early at night (8-10 p.m.) and the other just 

after  midnight.  Both  were  followed  by  a  strong  decrease  of  vocal  activity.  Although  this 

pattern  was  not  correlated  with  the  breathing  pattern,  lower  breathing  rates  were  observed 

just after those peaks. 

The peaks observed revealed a higher whistle rate than during day recordings which is 

in  accordance  both  with  the  finding  that  some  wild  dolphins  whistle  intensively  at  night 

(Atem  &  Monteiro-Filho  2006),  and  that  peaks  in  vocal  activity  may  occur  (Powell  1966). 

Indeed,  at  these  time  periods,  increased  repeatability  of  whistle  categories  and  short  inter-

whistle intervals may suggest that whistle matching interactions between group members did 

occur (Janik 2000; Janik et al. 2013) and that some degree of excitement could be involved 

(Díaz  López  &  Shirai  2009;  dos  Santos  et  al.  2005).  Other  cetaceans  such  as  humpback 

whales also show chorusing at night with peaks before and after midnight (Au et al. 2000). 

The  very  low  breathing  rates  observed  after  the  peaks,  especially  after  2  a.m., 

correspond to values associated to bottom or surface resting observed in another study (0.48 

and  1.05  respirations/minute/individual,  respectively;  Sekiguchi  &  Kohshima  2003).  These 

behaviours were associated with one or two eyes closed, thus potentially to sleep. Sleeping 

behaviour has been shown to occur mostly at night (0-3 a.m.; Sekiguchi & Kohshima 2003) 

with  low  breathing  and  vocal  activity  (Gnone  et  al.  2001;  Sekiguchi  &  Kohshima  2003). 

However, dolphins are not entirely quiet and sometimes even produce unusual vocalizations 
that seem to be vocally expressed rehearsals of day events (Kremers et al. 2011 (cid:224) paper 2). 

A previous study on vocal activity of captive bottlenose dolphins using 24h-recordings 

from 15 days found that both daytime and group composition had influence: whereas vocal 

activity showed peaks at 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. in a group composed of two adult, two juvenile 

males,  two  adult,  and  two  juvenile  females;  after  the  two  adult  males  were  removed  to 

another facility, only afternoon peaks were observed (Therrien et al. 2012). Maybe males are 

especially involved in these increased vocal activities, which would explain that these peaks 

were especially visible in our study, where three males were present. 

Finally,  the  repertoire  use  was  also  interesting  with  more  variety  and  especially 

“multilooped”  whistles  at  the  first  peak,  while  “rising”  whistles  were  predominant  at  the 

 

55 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

second peak. Dolphins tend to use a higher variety of sounds when excited (dos Santos et al. 

2005), which suggests that the first peak may indeed recall the roosting choruses observed in 

a  variety  of  species  (Adret-Hausberger  1982;  Kunz  1982),  which  are  followed  by  a  quiet 

phase  (here  about  0.05  whistles/minute/individual).  However,  contrarily  to  bird  roosts  in 

undisturbed conditions, a new peak arises later again. This second peak is yet different with a 

slightly  lower  whistle  rate  and  the  majority  of  whistles  being  “rising”  that  is  a  whistle 

category simpler in structure than “multilooped”. It may thus correspond to a less “excited” 

state  in  the  dolphin  group,  characterized  by  less  complex  whistles  and  less  repetitions. 

Furthermore, other social species are known to use simple call structures in coordination and 

synchronization contexts (primates: Boinski & Campbell 1995; birds: Black 1988). 

Sleep  cycle  length  in  dolphins  is  rarely  documented  but  seems  to  last  1-2  hours 

(Ridgway  2002).  This  may  explain  the  interval  between  the  two  vocal  peaks  observed. 

Overall, these data suggest that dusk chorusing occurs that precedes a first sleep phase while 

readjustment  after  two  hours  is  associated  with  a  renewed,  but  somewhat  quieter  vocal 

activity before a deeper, longer sleep period. 

However,  alternatively  it  is  possible  that  the  peaks  in  vocal  activity  observed  in  this 

study result from certain individuals that may be more vocal than others, repeating the same 

“multilooped” structures. Maybe this increased vocal activity indicates that this individual is 

more instrumental in coordinating the group’s activity. 

Chorusing behaviour in  cetaceans  has begun to  be studied only recently  and it seems 

likely that it serves different functions depending on the species. Chorusing in dolphins was 

mentioned  only  sporadically,  occurring  during  behaviours  that  seem  to  ensure  behavioural 

synchrony and social facilitation, and was assumed to serve in cohesion (Norris et al. 1994).  

Our findings contribute to provide further comprehension of vocal nocturnal activity in 

cetaceans.  They  suggest  that  vocal  activity  may  support  the  social  synchrony  observed  in 

groups of resting/sleeping dolphins and provide some further explanation for cetacean night 

choruses.  By  including  a  new  phylogenetical  group,  this  study  contributes  to  the  existing 

comparative studies on social aspects of chorusing. Finally, this study reveals that integrating 

more  research  on  dolphins  with  the  literature  on  birds  and  other  species  may  lead  to  new 

paths in cetacean behavioural research.

SUMMARY OF PAPER 2 

Questions: Dolphins are known to be able to copy sounds from their environment. Further it 
has  been  shown  that  dolphins  produce  vocal  copies  especially  in  the  presence  of  a  certain 
object  that  was  associated  with  the  original  sound.  This  implies  that  these  objects  were 
meaningful  to  the  dolphins.  Is  it  therefore  possible  to  assess  a  potential  meaningfulness 
through  the  dolphins’  vocal  productions?  Can  the  production  of  vocal  copies  serve  as 
indicator for the meaningfulness of the original sound or the context with which this sound 
was associated? 

Methods: We investigated hitherto unknown vocalization of the Planète Sauvage bottlenose 
dolphins  in  terms  of  acoustic  parameters  (discriminant  function  analysis)  and  sound 
similarity (playback experiment with human subjects).  

Results: We found that the unusual dolphin vocalizations were more similar to whale calls 
than to the dolphins’ own whistles in terms of acoustic parameters and sound similarity. The 
whale calls were part of the soundtrack accompanying the daily public shows. Dolphins were 
found to produce vocal copies of these sounds during their night time resting periods in the 
first weeks after the whale sounds were added to the soundtrack. Recordings made before the 
whale  sounds  started  being  broadcast  revealed  that  they  had  never  emitted  such  sounds 
before. 

Conclusions:  Bottlenose  dolphins  show  a  separation  between  auditory  memory  formation 
and vocal copy production and perhaps a vocally expressed nocturnal rehearsal of day events. 
Thus, vocalizations can serve as possible indicators of events or objects that are meaningful 
to the dolphins.

Abstract 

The mechanisms underlying vocal mimicry in animals remain an open question. Delphinidae 
are  able  to  copy  sounds  from  their  environment  that  are  not  produced  by  conspecifics. 
Usually, these mimicries occur associated with  the context  in  which they were learned. No 
reports  address  the  question  of  separation  between  auditory  memory  formation  and 
spontaneous  vocal  copying  although  the  sensory  and  motor  phases  of  vocal  learning  are 
separated in a variety of songbirds. Here we show that captive bottlenose dolphins produce, 
during  their  night  time  resting  periods,  non-dolphin  sounds  that  they  heard  during 
performance  shows.  Generally,  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  these  animals  produced  vocal 
copies  of  whale  sounds  that  had  been  broadcast  during  daily  public  shows.  As  their  life 
history was fully known, we know that these captive dolphins had never had the opportunity 
to  hear  whale  sounds  before  then.  Moreover,  recordings  made  before  the  whale  sounds 
started being broadcast  revealed that they had never emitted such sounds before. This  is  to 
our  knowledge  the  first  evidence  for  a  separation  between  formation  of  auditory  memories 
and the process of learning to produce calls that match these memories in a marine mammal. 
One hypothesis is that dolphins may rehearse some special events heard during the daytime 
and that they then express vocally what could be conceived as a more global memory. These 
results  open  the  way  for  broader  views  on  how  animals  might  rehearse  life  events  while 
resting or maybe dreaming.

1. 

INTRODUCTION 

Dolphins  have  the  ability  to  copy  sounds  from  their  environment  other  than  those 

produced  by  conspecifics,  like  orang-utans  or  elephants,  under  captive  conditions  when 

mimicries  are  associated  with  salient  events,  such  as  training  or  shows  (Kelley  &  Healy 

2011;  Poole  et  al.  2005;  Richards  et  al.  1984;  Wich  et  al.  2009).  Interspecific  copying  by 

cetaceans  has been reported under  field  conditions,  seemingly in  association with  agonistic 

interactions (May-Collado 2010), social separation (Foote et al. 2006), or other emotionally 

salient contexts. Earlier anecdotic reports concerning birds mention that vocal mimicry can in 

some  cases  emerge  and  be  kept  in  memory  in  association  with  particularly  salient  events 

(Armstrong  1960;  Frith  &  Frith  2004),  one  famous  example  being  Lorenz’s  (1952)  free-

living,  tame  hooded  crow  (Armstrong  1960)  coming  back  with  a  broken  foot  and  a  never 

before heard sentence: “Got’im in t’bloomin’trap” (in “Austrian street language”). 

Examples  of  separation  between  auditory  memory  formation  and  vocal  copying  are 

common in a variety of songbird (e.g. Thorpe 1961) and parrot (Pepperberg 1997) species, 

when the sensory  and motor phases of vocal learning are separated. Songbirds can produce 

vocal copies totally independently of the context in which they were learned (Hausberger et 

al.  1991).  Similarly,  dolphins  are  capable  of  associating  given  sounds  with  an  object  or 

context (Reiss & McCowan 1993; Richards et al. 1984). Hooper et al. (2006) demonstrated 

that dolphins’ imitations can be enhanced by associating sounds with salient events. Here we 

questioned  whether  dolphins  would  produce  copies  of  whale  sounds  associated  with  daily 

shows, a salient event for them.  

One  intriguing  finding  is  the  activation  of  the  same  neurons  during  sleep  as  while 

awake  in  songbirds,  which  suggests  a  rehearsal  of  song  during  sleep  (Dave  et  al.  2000). 

Actually, memories of salient events can lead to rehearsal in the form of dreams during sleep 

both  in  humans and animals  (Cipolli et  al.  2004). Animals  that have undergone a lesion of 

their locus coeruleus present motor expressions of their dreams, e.g. hunting in sleeping cats 

(Jouvet 1979). Vocalizations during sleep are commonly reported, as for instance in  horses 

(Ruckebusch  et  al.  1970).  Speech  produced  by  humans  during  sleep  corresponds  to  their 

dream  contents  (Jouvet  1979).  The  quality  of  dreams  depends  on  the  type  of  sleep;  more 

negative-emotional  type  dreaming  occurs  during  REM  (i.e.  rapid  eye  movement)  sleep 

(Stickgold  et  al.  2001),  whereas  during  non-REM  (or  day)  dreams,  the  episodic  memory 

 

65 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

(memory of an event as a whole) is more involved (Stickgold et al. 2001; Vandekerckhove & 

Clydts  2010):  an  “offline  model  of  the  world”  where  events  and  social  interactions  are 

associated  in  a  “vivid  and  multimodal  simulation  of  real  experience”  (Revonsuo  2000). 

Therefore we hypothesized that vocal copies could occur at night during resting or sleeping.  

Here  we  describe  the  nocturnal  production  of  vocal  mimicries  by  captive  bottlenose 

dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  of  whale  sounds  that  they  only  heard  during  daytime  show 

periods (i.e. whale songs played back to the public through loudspeakers). Our results reveal 

that delayed production of auditory memories does occur in dolphins, one explanation being 

that  they  have  a  memory  of  sounds  associated  with  salient  events,  which  would  then  be 

produced during rehearsals. 

 

2.  MATERIAL & METHODS 

2.1.  Background 

2.1.1. Study group and housing conditions. 

Subjects were five captive-born dolphins (2 females, 3 males, from 5 to 25 

years  old)  housed  at  the  “Planète  Sauvage”  delphinarium  (France).  They  have 

been  in  this  facility  as  a  group  since  December  2008  and  came  from  two 

delphinarium  belonging  to  the  same  company.  In  all,  this  facility  covers  over 

2000m² water surface and contains 8 500 000 L salt water cleaned with ozone (no 

chlorine).  They  were  feed  comprised  variety  of  fish  (herring,  capelin,  sprat, 

mackerel,  and  whiting)  and  squid.  The  daily  ration  of  5-10  kg  per  individual 

(depending  on  its  size)  was  given  several  different  times  during  feeding  or 

training  sessions.  Training  includes  medical  training  (e.g.  acceptance  of 

inspection  and  palpation  of  all  parts  of  the  body  or  being  touched  by  medical 

equipment) as well as training for public shows. 

 

2.1.2. Public shows 

The  dolphins  performed  exercises  during  daily  public  shows  (one  to  four 

per day, depending on the season). These educative shows were composed of a 

set of activities (each time performed in a different order so that the dolphins did 

not  become  bored)  aiming  to  explain  dolphins’  biology  and  behaviour  to  the 

 

66 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

public:  demonstration  of  body  features  (dorsal  and  pectoral  fins,  fluke, 

blowhole),  physical  abilities  (swimming  at  maximum  speed,  jumping),  visual 

abilities (catching thrown balls), sounds (in-air vocalizations). During the shows, 

a trainer commented the different activities. From the 28 February 2009 on, a 21 

minutes  soundtrack  was  broadcast  at  the  beginning  of  the  shows  (while  the 

visitors came in and sat down), which included music, sea gulls’ calls, dolphins’ 

whistles  (their  own)  and  predominantly  humpback  whales’  vocalizations.  The 

playbacks of humpback whale sounds were only broadcast in the current facility 

and during the period of shows, in total for approximately 2 minutes (a 14-second 

sequence  of  5  whale  calls  was  repeated  8  times  during  the  21-minute  music 

track), generally 2-3 times a day. 

 

2.1.3. Data collection 

The  vocalizations  were  recorded  between  November  2008  and  May  2009 

for  nine  days  and  eight  nights.  The  recordings  were  performed  using  a  Nauta 

SS03-10  hydrophone  connected  to  a  Marantz  PMD  670  recorder  (sample  rate: 

44.1  kHz;  resolution:  16  bit)  without  the  possibility  to  identify  emitters. 

Observations complied with the current French laws governing animal research. 

2.2.  Discriminant function analysis 

We  compared  dolphins’  vocalizations  with  the  broadcast  whale  sounds  by 

measuring  frequency  and  time  parameters  using  Raven  Pro  1.3.  Measurements  were 

then  analysed  using  a  stepwise  Discriminant  function  analysis  (in  SPSS  11.5).  Only 

high  quality  (i.e.  low  background  noise)  “whale-like”  productions  (WLPs)  and 

randomly chosen whistles were used. 

2.3.  Human playback experiment 

To  evaluate  dolphin-whale  similarities  five  WLPs  (at  normal  speed  and  half 

speed) and five whale sounds were broadcast to 20 human subjects (male and female 

master and PhD students and scientists working in behavioural biology) that were blind 

to  the  study  and  unfamiliar  with  cetacean  vocalizations.  Again  only  high  quality 

 

 

 

67 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

whistles and WLPs (i.e. low background noise) were chosen from our own recordings. 

Three humpback whale calls from the Planète Sauvage broadcast were used as well as 

two additional calls from free-ranging individuals (www.whalesong.net) to see if these 

calls differed. Dolphins’ whistles, WLPs and whale calls were chosen so that they all 

had  approximately  the  same  duration  in  order  to  avoid  classification  based  on  the 

length of the sound. Since the WLPs were said to sound like “accelerated” versions of 

the  real  whale  sounds,  we  also  tested  slowed  down  (factor  of  0.5)  versions  of  the 

WLPs. To ensure that dolphins’ WLPs were not classified as different from dolphins’ 

whistles  because  of  this  manipulation,  the  whistles  were  played  back  both  at  normal 

speed  and  slowed  down.  The  sounds  were  equalized  (71.8  dB)  in  sound  level  using 

ANA software and a DVM401 Voltcraft decibel meter. A set of five whale sounds, 10 

dolphin whistles (five normal speed/five half speed) and 10 dolphin WLPs (five normal 

speed / five half speed) was randomly broadcast to each subject. After listening to an 

example of a whale and a dolphin sounds (not included in the testing set), subjects were 

asked  to  classify  the  sounds  as  a  “whale”  or  “dolphin”  sound.  Human  classifications 

were compared using a Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni corrections (Pcorrected = 0.003). 

 

3.  RESULTS 

3.1.  General results 

Recordings performed between November 2008 and February 2009 (> 80 hours) 

yielded 2370 vocalizations (2182 whistles, 188 burst-pulsed) from five dolphins. After 

the  broadcast  of  the  soundtrack  started,  recordings  were  made  between  February  and 

May 2009 (40 hours) yielding 876 vocalizations (218 during the day; 658 at night, i.e. 

10 p.m. to 06 a.m.). Whereas the vocalizations during the day did not change after the 

broadcast  started,  atypical  sounds  were  recorded  during  the  night;  these  sounds  had 

never  been  recorded  before  the  broadcast  had  started.  The  first  atypical  sound  was 

recorded  after  87  playbacks  of  the  show  tape  (after  34  days  with  broadcast).  Most 

remarkable was that 20 of the 25 atypical sounds were recorded between 1 and 3 a.m. 

(Table  1),  which  is  during  early  night  when  the  animals  were  resting,  or  even 

potentially sleeping. The five remaining sounds were recorded early morning (6-9 a.m.) 

while the dolphins were also resting. None of these atypical sounds was ever recorded

during a show, which would suggest immediate mimicry, or during periods of intense 

activity. Comparisons with the past and present acoustic environment of these animals 

and  these  vocalizations  revealed  that  the  only  close  structure  was  the  whale  sounds 

broadcast during the public shows. The life history of these animals was  fully known 

(same company) and these dolphins had had no opportunity to hear such whale sounds 

at any stage. 

Table 2: Acoustic parameters and recording times of dolphins’ and humpback  whales’ vocalizations. Data for 
wild bottlenose dolphins were taken from Ding et al. (1995) as an example; humpback whale sounds were taken 
from The Ocean Mammal Institute (http://www.oceanmammalinst.com/songs.html) and The Whalesong Project 
(http://www.whalesong.net/index.php/the-whalesong-project/sounds/whale-songs).  The

dolphins’  whistles  were  chosen  randomly  from  our  own  recordings  with  the  aim  to  match  approximately  the 
WLPs (“whale-like” productions) sample size and humpback whale sounds. Acoustic measurements are given as

3.2.  Acoustic analysis 

These  atypical  vocalizations  clearly  stood  out  from  the  range  of  classical 

descriptions  of  dolphin  whistles’  characteristics  (Table  1),  being  characterized  by  a 

lower pitch and a larger number of harmonics (Figure 1). The dolphins also produced 

other  low-pitched,  namely  burst-pulsed  vocalizations  (Figure  1,  1.(B)),  which  are  not 

unusual in the dolphins’ vocal repertoire (van der Woude 2009; dos Santos et al. 1995; 

Connor  and  Smolker  1996).  Nevertheless,  these  “whale-like”  productions  (WLPs; 

Figure  1,  2.(A))  clearly  differed  from  their  burst-pulsed  vocalizations  in  terms  of 

 

69 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

noisiness  and  frequency  modulation  patterns;  they  also  lasted  much  longer  and  were 

higher pitched. 

 

 

Figure  1:  A  spectrogram  of  the  Plantète  Sauvage  dolphins’  1.  common  vocal  repertoire,  (A)  whistles 
and (B) burst-pulsed vocalizations, and 2. their atypical (A) whale-like productions (WLPs) and (B) the 
“model”  humpback  whales’  sounds. FFT: 1(A) 1024; 1(B), 2(A) and 2(B) 2282. The  time  axes for all 
spectrograms have been standardized; but the 1(A) frequency axis has been extended. 

 

To  ensure  that  these  productions  were  copies,  sounds  being  broadcast  and  the 

dolphins’ WLPs were compared both in terms of measurements and by testing a naïve 

human  audience  (see  3.3.  Human  playback  experiment).  A  discriminant  function 

analysis, based on temporal and frequency parameters, clearly separated the “ordinary” 

dolphin  whistles  from  both  WLPs  and  the  “model”  whale  sounds,  while  the  latter 

overlapped  (Figure  2;  percentage  of  correctly  classified  cases:  dolphins’  whistles 

100%,  dolphins’  WLPs  60.0%  (40.0%  classified  as  “whale  sounds”),  humpback 

whales’ sounds 88.9% (11.1% classified as “dolphins’ WLPs”)).

frequency (canonical correlation coefficient = 0.949; Wilks-λ = 0.069; P ≤ 0.001); discriminant function 
2  corresponds  to  number  of  harmonics  (canonical  correlation  coefficient  =  0.551;  Wilks-λ  =  0.696; 
P = 0.001). 

 

 

3.3.  Human playback experiment 

Human evaluations confirmed these findings. After listening to an example of a 

humpback  whale  and  a  dolphin  sound  (humpback  whale  sound  from  The  Ocean 

Mammal  Institute;  dolphin  sound  randomly  chosen  from  our  own  recordings  of  this 

group), they  were asked to classify the sounds  as being produced by  a whale or by  a 

dolphin.  While  the  model  whale  sounds  and  ordinary  dolphin  whistles  were  clearly 

identified  as  such  (88-99%),  WLPs  were  often  classified  as  being  a  whale  sound, 

especially when slowed down (76%) (Figure 3; Wilcoxon test, P ≤ 0.000).

4.  DISCUSSION 

This study describes an unusually delayed production during the night of mimicries of 

sounds  related  to  salient  events.  The  fact  that  these  mimicries  are  produced  when  the 

dolphins are resting or sleeping and never when they were active is intriguing, especially as 

these  sounds  were  only  broadcast  in  the  context  of  daytime  shows.  Hooper  et  al.  (2006) 

showed that mimicries are enhanced by association of sounds with objects or events, and that 

dolphins tend to produce these sounds in the corresponding contexts/activities. Therefore this 

raises the question of whether these night productions correspond to a form of “rehearsal” of 

daily shows. None of these vocalizations  had ever been recorded before  this broadcast  was 

performed and information of the dolphins’ life history clearly established that these animals 

had  never  had  the  opportunity  to  hear  whale  sounds  previously.  These  mimicries  occurred 

 

72 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

neither  in  direct  association  with  the  event,  nor  during  interactions  with  humans  and  other 

dolphins. Data concerning both objective measurements of sound parameters and evaluations 

by humans converge to show that these atypical  vocalizations were mimicries of the whale 

sounds broadcast during shows. Dolphins transposed frequencies as do killer whales (Foote 

et  al.  2006)  and  a  variety  of  mimicking  birds  (songbirds:  Hausberger  et  al.  1991;  parrots: 

Cruickshank et al. 1993). There may be some physical constraints, as the preferred range of 

frequencies for dolphin copying seems to be between 5-10 kHz (Richards et al. 1984). Other 

authors give examples of low pitched vocalizations emitted by dolphins (Connor & Smolker 

1996; dos Santos et al. 1995; van der Woude 2009) and the question of whether these sounds 

correspond to mimicries has been raised (van der Woude 2009). The sounds produced here 

clearly  differ  from  these  examples  in  their  acoustic  structure:  WLPs  are  longer  in  duration 

and present more frequency modulations than do “brays” (dos Santos et al. 1995) and “pops” 

(Connor  &  Smolker  1996),  and  their  minimum  and  maximum  frequencies  are  higher  than 

those of “moans” (van der Woude 2009). They also differ from other parts of the dolphin’s 

species specific repertoire (reviewed in Janik 2009). 

These mimicries are a further proof that dolphins can learn when adult, as they heard 

this tape only when adult. The most remarkable aspect though is the delayed production of 

these  mimicries  in  a  quiet  context.  The  “salience”  of  the  event/interaction  may  have  been 

crucial  (Hooper  et  al.  2006;  Tyack  &  Sayigh  1997).  These  atypical  vocalizations  might  be 

episodes of “vocal play” while at rest (Kuczaj & Makecha 2008; Pepperberg 2002), or, given 

the  context,  a  potential  part  of  a  global  rehearsal  of  these  salient  daytime  events.  The 

mimicries occurred only at quiet times, mostly during the night (0-3 a.m.), and outside any 

kind of social interactions, while obviously resting or sleeping. In captivity, show periods are 

salient  events  associated  with  multisensory  stimulations  (food  reinforcement,  vocal  orders, 

public  responses…).  In  addition  to  the  general  background  (crowd,  noise,…)  that  may  be 

emotionally  salient,  food  reinforcement  used  by  trainers  may  increase  excitation  (Innes  & 

McBride  2008)  and  long  term  memories  (Sankey  et  al.  2010);  positive  as  well  as  negative 

emotional  valences  could  potentially  induce  increased  mimicry  and  strong  memories 

(Armstrong 1960).  

This  is  to  our  knowledge  the  first  time  that  a  long  separation  between  hearing  an 

auditory  model  and  copying  it  has  been  observed  in  a  marine  mammal.  One  hypothesis 

 

73 

Chapter 3: Nocturnal Umwelt of dolphins 

predicts  that  dolphins,  like  parrots  or  songbirds,  “practice”  outside  the  “model’s”  presence 

(Hausberger  et  al.  1991).  Another  hypothesis  predicts  that  these  events  correspond  to 

rehearsals  of a more global  memory, as  for example in  the form  of dreams  during sleep or 

“day dreaming” in humans and animals (Cipolli et al. 2004). Reports of potential “dreaming” 

remain  anecdotal  in  species  other  than  laboratory  animals.  A  pilot  study  by  Lubrano 

Lavadera  (2005)  reported  that  young  horses  produced  adult  vocalizations  (that  they  never 

produced  during  the  day)  during  REM  (i.e.  rapid  eye  movement)  sleep.  This  question  is 

especially  intriguing  as  cetaceans  seem  to  lack  typical  REM  sleep,  or  may  have  very  short 

bouts  of  it  (Mukhametov  1995;  Shpak  et  al.  2009).  Nevertheless  periods  of  sleep,  mostly 

between  0  and  3  a.m.,  but  also  at  times  during  the  day,  have  been  described,  when  the 

animals are floating or swimming slowly (Lyamin et al. 2008; Sekiguchi & Kohshima 2003). 

Resting periods are associated with lower whistle production rates (Sekiguchi  & Kohshima 

2003). Muscle jerks recalling REM sleep have been observed (Lyamin et al. 2008). Whether 

or  not  dolphins  experience  any  kind  of  rehearsal  of  daytime  events  during  their  sleep 

therefore  remains  a  mystery,  although  anecdotal  reports  by  trainers  suggest  that  dolphins 

perform  a  trained  task  better  in  the  morning.  Improvement  of  performance  is  a  proved 

consequence of the rehearsal of memories in human dreams (Aly & Moscovitch 2010).  

As individuals and precise behavior could not be identified in this study, only further 

investigations associating EEG (electroencephalography) recordings, could confirm or infirm 

our hypothesis that these productions reflect rehearsal of daytime events by dolphins during 

rest or sleep. Their rarity (1.1% of total production) and timing (mostly at night) may explain 

that  this  constitutes  the  first  report  of  mimicries  of  sounds  heard  during  special  events 

produced  by  dolphins  in  a  resting/sleeping  context.  This  finding  opens  very  large 

perspectives  for  future 

investigations  on  dolphin 

learning  processes  and  “mental 

representations”.

SUMMARY OF PAPER 3 

Questions: Theoretically, a dolphin would simply need to open its mouth to have access to a 
huge amount of chemical information existent in the surrounding water. However, gustation 
did not receive much attention by research. As wild and captive dolphins are known to have 
feeding preferences, we asked whether or not these preferences might be guided by taste. Are 
dolphins able to discriminate food by its taste?   

Methods:  We  investigated  the  response  of  the  Planète  Sauvage  dolphins  towards  visually 
and tactually identical ice cubes that differed in taste (herring, salmon, shrimp, and control). 
Since  preferences  were  tested,  we  analysed  the  dolphins’  latency  to  return  and  beg  for 
another ice cube. 

Results: Dolphins took more time to come back after they received ice cubes that tasted like 
herring  or  salmon  compared  to  non-fish-tasting  ones,  an  indirect  assessment  of  more 
exploration of fish-tasting ice cubes.  

Conclusions:  Bottlenose  dolphins  responded  differently  to  ice  cubes  with  different  tastes. 
Thus,  they  seem  to  be  able  to  discriminate  food  by  its  taste.  Gustation  might  be  a  so  far 
underestimated modality in the dolphin’s Merkwelt.

Abstract 

The  dolphins’  chemosensory  world  remains  poorly  understood.  Whereas  much  is  known 
about  their  acoustic  abilities,  little  knowledge  is  at  hand  on  other  modalities,  especially 
chemoreception. While dolphins live in an environment that is replete with chemical stimuli, 
there  is  no  consensus  on  whether  and  how  they  do  perceive  them.  Morphological, 
neuroanatomical,  and  molecular  studies  remain  dubious  on  that  issue,  whereas  behavioural 
and ethoecological data suggest that dolphins may use chemoreception for food selection or 
socio-sexual  interactions.  However,  very  few  studies  have  been  performed  due  to 
methodological issues. In the present study, we developed a new non-invasive method based 
on dolphins’ liking for ice cubes in order to assess captive dolphins’ ability to discriminate 
chemical stimuli in form of food flavours. Therefore, we offered them visually and tactually 
similar ice cubes that differed only in terms of flavour. Fish (herring, salmon) and non-fish 
(shrimp,  control)  flavours  were  used  to  assess  these  dolphins’  potential  spontaneous 
preference  for  i)  fish  over  non-fish  stimuli,  and  ii)  familiar  (herring)  over  non-familiar 
(salmon) fish stimuli. Ice cubes were distributed on the dolphins’ demand and the individual 
latency to return begging for another one was timed. Dolphins took more time to come back 
after they received fish-flavoured ice cubes compared to non-fish-flavoured ones, an indirect 
assessment of more exploration of fish-flavoured ice cubes. These data suggest that dolphins 
may be able to discriminate food types based only on  gustative cues. This method provides 
an interesting tool for the study of dolphin chemoreception.

1. 

INTRODUCTION 

The efficiency of chemoreception in  cetaceans  is still a debated question. On the one 

hand,  several  authors  posit  that  some  cetacean  species  have  lost  their  nasal  (Kishida  et  al. 

2007)  and  oral  chemoreception  (Jiang  et  al.  2013)  in  the  course  of  evolution,  as  airborne 

odorants may be considered irrelevant due to their aquatic lifestyle (Thewissen et al. 2011). 

Firstly,  corresponding  anatomical  structures  are  rudimentary  or  absent,  at  least  in  adult 

animals. In the nasal cavity of toothed whales, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and 

ethmoturbinals are absent (Pihlström 2008). In their oral cavity, no taste buds were found on 

the  tongue  or  other  body  areas  of  various  odontocete  species  (Kuznetzov  1990).  However, 

the  number/age  of  individuals  investigated  is  usually  unknown  or  very  limited.  Secondly, 

central  structures  devoted  to  olfaction  are  rudimentary  or  absent.  The  main  and  accessory 

olfactory tracts are completely absent in toothed whales, and absent or considerably reduced 

in  baleen  whales  (Oelschläger  2008;  Pihlström  2008).  Finally,  olfactory  and  taste  receptor 

genes are mostly pseudogenised or entirely absent in Odontoceti (Jiang et al. 2013; Kishida 

et al. 2007).  

On the other hand, numerous studies argue in favour of functional chemoreception in 

cetaceans. Firstly, chemoreceptive cells were found in the frontal and vestibular sac (close to 

the  blowhole)  of  harbour  porpoises  (Behrmann  1989),  perhaps  enabling  some  kind  of 

chemical sensation in this species. Moreover, taste buds were found in younger individuals of 

the same species that were previously described as not having them when investigating adult 

individuals (Behrmann 1988; Kuznetzov 1990; Yamasaki et al. 1978). Other studies did not 

describe  taste  buds  but  found  marginal  and  vallate  papillae  on  the  tongues  of  dolphins, 

known to be potential locations of taste buds (Kastelein  & Dubbeldam 1990; Werth 2007). 

Secondly,  Odontoceti  were  found 

to  possess  a  well-developed  olfactory 

tubercle 

(Oelschläger  &  Oelschläger  2009).  Finally,  go/no-go  behavioural  tests  with  trained 

bottlenose dolphins showed that they can perceive sour, bitter and salty tastes nearly as well 

as humans (Friedl et al. 1990; Kuznetzov 1990; Nachtigall & Hall 1984). 

Taken together, this second set of studies suggests that cetaceans might have, to some 

extent,  access  to  chemosensory  information  through  the  olfactory  (Thewissen  et  al.  2011) 

and/or  taste  systems  (Pihlström  2008;  Watkins  &  Wartzok  1985).  As  anatomical, 

neuroanatomical, and molecular evidence draw unclear conclusions, behavioural studies are 

 

83 

Chapter 4: Chemoreception in dolphins 

needed.  Given  the  complex  but  sometimes  subtle  behaviours  displayed  by  dolphins  in 

response  to  internal  or  external  stimuli,  go/no-go  tasks  are  an  elegant  way  to  investigate 

perceptive  abilities;  however,  they  require  to  train  the  animals,  thus  preventing  the 

investigation  of  dolphins’  spontaneous  responses.  Therefore,  the  go/no-go  paradigm  is  not 

suitable for exploring the presence of preferences that are per se spontaneous and cannot be 

tested  in  a  trained  task.  Furthermore,  it  takes  time  to  train  the  animals  what  makes  other 

methods  that  take  spontaneous  responses  into  account  more  attractive  as  they  are  easier 

applicable. 

The present study aimed at testing whether bottlenose dolphins display discriminative 

behavioural responses toward different stimuli presented as fish or non-fish flavours, and as 

familiar  or  non-familiar  food  items.  Wild  dolphins  are  indeed  reported  to  display  clear 

feeding selectivity: they tend to prefer fish rather than crustaceans (Spitz et al. 2006) and also 

high  rather  than  low  energy  fish  (Spitz  et  al.  2010).  One  possibility  is  that  dolphins  make 

food  choices  based  on  visual  or  texture  differences.  Another  possibility  relates  to  choices 

based  on  taste,  odour,  or  flavour  differences  (flavour  being  defined  as  the  perceptual  mix 

between olfaction, gustation, and oro-nasal somesthesis). Thus, we controlled the texture and 

visual  aspects  of  a  set  of  chemical  stimuli  in  shaping  them  as  coloured  and  flavoured  ice 

cubes.  In  these  conditions,  we  predicted  that,  if  bottlenose  dolphins  have  the  capacity  to 

detect  chemical  stimuli,  they  should  behave  discriminatively  in  response  to  different 

flavours,  along  qualitative  features  involving  their  source  (i.e.,  fish/non-fish)  or  along 

previous  exposure  to  the  stimuli  (familiar/unfamiliar).  In  the  current  study,  we  aimed  at 

testing potential spontaneous preferences for food flavours in a “naturalistic” setting, i.e., in 

conditions where dolphins may express their preferences without going through conditioning 

procedures. Since dolphins are not visible all the time in such conditions, we had to develop 

an indirect approach to measuring flavour discrimination. Thus, we used the latency of return 

to the begging spot for ice cubes as a measure of “interest” in the previous ice cube flavour. 

Since  ice  cubes  are  highly  attractive,  longer  latencies  to  beg  again  reflected  the  time  spent 

“exploring” the previous ice cube, and hence were considered as reflecting greater interest in 

the dolphins.  Opportunistic observations  of dolphins’ behaviour  after receiving an ice  cube 

revealed that they tended to spend time “exploring” it in the mouth. Our method used a non-

 

84 

invasive technique based on the spontaneous begging responses of dolphins toward more or 

Chapter 4: Chemoreception in dolphins   

less attractive items bearing biological relevance. 

 

2.  MATERIAL & METHODS 

2.1.  Subjects and facility 

In January and February 2012, we studied four captive-born bottlenose dolphins 

(three  males  aged  8,  12,  and  27  years;  one  female  aged  10  years)  that  were  housed 

together for more than 3 years in the delphinarium of Planète Sauvage (Port-Saint-Père, 

France).  Overall,  the  facility  covers  over  2000  m²  water  surface  and  contains 

8.500.000 L  of  salt  water  cleaned  with  ozone  (without  any  chlorine).  The  diet  of  the 

dolphins was composed of frozen stored herring, capelin, sprat, mackerel, whiting, and 

squid.  The  species  composition  changed  on  a  daily  basis  but  contained  at  least  three 

different fish species each day. A daily ration of 5-10 kg per individual (depending on 

its weight) was given throughout the day during eight feedings (lasting ca. 15 minutes 

each), the first at 9:00 a.m. and the last at 5:00 p.m. These feedings were conducted by 

the dolphin trainers, using the food as primary reinforcement for medical training (e.g., 

acceptance  of  inspection  and  palpation  of  all  parts  of  the  body  or  being  touched  by 

medical equipment) as well as training for public shows. Food was given by the trainer 

directly in the dolphin’s mouth. 

 

2.2.  Stimuli and procedure 

As the matrix to present different food flavours, we used ice cubes, which were 

equally familiar to all dolphins as they were commonly used as part of environmental 

enrichment  in  the  delphinarium  (1-2  times  per  week);  therefore,  all  dolphins  were 

accustomed to receive, sense, and ingest odour- and tasteless ice cubes. For the present 

experiment,  ice  cubes  were  produced  with  herring,  salmon,  and  shrimp  flavours 

(Table 1),  originally  used  for  human  cooking  (salmon/shrimp)  or  for  baiting  fish 

(herring). Herring was familiar to all dolphins through food exposure, whereas salmon 

and shrimp were not. Semispherical ice cubes (basis diameter: 4 cm; height: 2.5 cm) of 

20  mL  each  were  made  with  plain  mineral  water  (to  ensure  constant  composition; 

“Volvic” Danone, Paris, France) in which the flavour was diluted.

Flavourless yellow or purple food colourants (“Crazy Colors” Brauns-Heitmann 

Ltd., Warburg, Germany) were added to homogenize the ice cubes’ visual appearance 

for the dolphins. To prevent any flavour-colour association by the dolphins, the colours 

were  randomly  distributed  over  ice  cubes  carrying  different  flavours.  Ice  cube  were 

frozen at -21.5°C.  

Experimental sessions were performed 1-5 times per day, with at least 60 minutes 

between two experimental sessions and with the largest possible time interval between 

experimental and feeding session. During one experimental session, (lasting on average 

10 minutes (8 ±  2 minutes) one single flavour was  tested. We completed all sessions 

for a given flavour before testing a new flavour.  

All  dolphins  were  together  in  the  pool  and  when  they  saw  the  experimenter 

(D.K.)  coming,  they  immediately  and  spontaneously  approached  her  standing  at  the 

side of the pool. The experimental session started when the experimenter took up her 

position at the pool (no other person was around the pool) where she was standing with 

the ice cubes being within reach. The experimenter, who was familiar with all dolphins 

and  could  identify  each  individual  without  any  doubt  on  the  basis  of  physical 

differences (e.g., shape of the dorsal fin or colour patterns of the skin), never interacted 

with  the  dolphins  beside  of  responding  to  their  begging  by  giving  an  ice  cube  (see 

below).  Although  all  dolphins  were  together  in  the  pool,  however,  the  interaction 

between the dolphins was minimal in front of the experimenter, as rarely more than one 

individual  at  a  time  was  present  in  front  of  the  experimenter.  Dolphins  were  free  to 

participate, meaning that they received ice cubes only when begging, i.e., when clearly 

opening  their  rostrum  with  the  head  and  eyes  over  the  water  surface  while  being 

oriented to, and less than 1 m away from, the experimenter (Figure 1).

Figure 5: A dolphin begging for an ice cube. 

 

This behaviour was displayed only in this context and was obviously identifiable. 

After this begging behaviour, the experimenter let the ice cube fall in the open mouth 

of the dolphin where it landed mostly at the middle of the tongue. Begging latency was 

timed  by  the  experimenter  with  a  chronometer  from  the  moment  a  given  dolphin 

received an ice cube (contact with the tongue) to the moment it begged for a new one 

(as  described  above).  This  parameter  was  the  only  one  independent  of  the  dolphins’ 

position, as other behaviours that occurred between the receipt of an ice cube and the 

begging of a new one (e.g., playing with the ice cube) were not visible as the dolphins 

swam around in the pool. 

The  four  stimuli  were  tested  consecutively,  i.e.  one  by  one  at  consecutive  days 

[1. herring  (N  =  242  ice  cubes  distributed  in  total;  13  sessions),  2.  salmon  (N  =  199; 

12 sessions), 3. shrimp (N = 206; 12 sessions), 4. control, N = 246; 12 sessions)]. The 

order of the four stimuli was chosen randomly.

2.3.  Data analysis 

Statistic calculations were run using R software (version 2.15.0, R Development 

Core  Team,  www.r-project.org).  Assuming  that  all  dolphins  react  differently  to  fish 

(salmon/herring) vs. non-fish (shrimp/control) items or to familiar (herring/control) vs. 

unfamiliar  (salmon/shrimp)  food,  we  compared  begging  latencies  between  different 

flavours by using a Wald test on a Linear Mixed Model, considering the individual as 

random factor (R-package: lme4). Data have been log-transformed prior to analyses in 

order  to  homogenize  the  variances.  Pairwise  comparisons  were  performed  with  the 

contrasts  method  (correction  for  multiple  testing:  false  discovery  rate;  R-package: 

doBy).  As  dolphins  were  free  to  participate  in  this  experiment,  number  of  ice  cubes 

received differed between individuals and between different tastes. However, this was 

taken into account by treating individual as random factor in the statistical analysis. 

3.  RESULTS 

The  average  latency  of  the  four  dolphins  to  beg  for  another  ice  cube  differed 

significantly between the distinctly flavoured ice cubes (mixed LM: χ² = 19.16; p = 0.0003; 

Table  2).  Post-hoc  tests  indicated  that  all  dolphins  took  more  time  to  come  back  after 

receiving  herring-  or  salmon-flavoured  ice  cubes  than  after  receiving  shrimp-flavoured  or 

control ice cubes (all dyadic comparisons: 5.04 ≤ χ² ≤ 13.84; 0.001 ≤ p ≤ 0.037; Figure 2).

Both  fish-flavoured  ice  cubes  triggered  latencies  (mean  ±  SE:  herring  46 ± 4  sec., 

salmon 44 ± 4 sec.) that did not differ significantly (χ² = 0.54; p = 0.553); likewise, latencies 

after non-fish tasting (shrimp 33 ± 3 sec.) and control ice cubes (control 30 ± 3 sec.) did not 

differ  significantly  (χ²  =  0.33;  p  =  0.564).  The  two  familiar  flavours  (herring  and  control) 

elicited different latencies (χ² = 8.64; p = 0.007); the same was true for the two non-familiar 

flavours (salmon and shrimp: χ² = 9.19; p = 0.007).

4.  DISCUSSION 

Using an original method to test spontaneous preferences of dolphins for food flavours, 

it was possible to show that responses of four captive bottlenose dolphins to visually similar 

stimuli differed dependent on the flavour. Dolphins took more time to beg for a new ice cube 

after  receiving  herring/salmon  ice  cubes  compared  to  shrimp/control  ice  cubes,  indicating 

that  they  discriminated  between  fish  and  non-fish  flavours  which  triggered  a  differential 

attention.  Earlier  observations  suggest  that  a  prolonged  latency  reflects  a  longer  time  spent 

 

89 

Chapter 4: Chemoreception in dolphins 

“exploring”  the  flavour  by  the  dolphin.  Whether  stimuli  were  familiar  (herring/control)  or 

unfamiliar (salmon/shrimp) did not impact their response. Therefore, this study suggests that 

dolphins  are  capable  to  perceive  chemical  stimuli  (Friedl  et  al.  1990;  Kuznetzov  1990; 

Nachtigall & Hall 1984) and may use this perceptive ability on biologically relevant stimuli.  

One factor which may guide food choices of dolphins is energy density. Free-ranging 

common dolphins do indeed select preferentially high-energy density prey even though they 

are  less  abundant  (Spitz  et  al.  2010).  In  line  with  this,  salmons  and  herring,  the  flavours 

eliciting longer latencies in  our study,  are about  1.5-2.5 times more  energetic than shrimps 

(National  Nutrient  Database  for  Standard  Reference).  Another  factor  may  be  flavour 

preference  that  could  promote  the  choice  of  a  certain  food.  Bottlenose  dolphins’  diet  is 

primarily  composed  of  fish  (94.2  %  in  stranded  dolphins’  stomach  contents),  whereas 

crustaceans  are  eaten  only  occasionally  (2.0  %;  Spitz  et  al.  2006),  what  might  be  caused, 

aside from factors such as prey habitat (pelagic/benthic), by a preference for the flavour of 

fish.   

We must acknowledge some limitations to our report. First, social facilitation was not 

controlled in  our setting. However,  although  all dolphins  were always  together in  the pool, 

interactions  between  them  were  minimal,  as  rarely  more  than  one  individual  at  a  time  was 

present  in  front  of  the  experimenter.  Second,  the  experimenter  was  not  blind  regarding  the 

flavour given to dolphins. Third, we only used non-original (i.e., real fish/shrimp) flavours. 

Further  studies  should  take  these  factors  into  account.  Nevertheless,  we  could  demonstrate 

that  the  method  applied  has  several  advantages  because  it  allows  to  non-invasively  test 

dolphins’  discriminative  abilities  and  is  therefore  easily  applicable  and  replicable.  The 

responses  of  the  tested  bottlenose  dolphins  to  differently  flavoured  stimuli  support  the 

assumption  that  this  species  is  chemosensitive,  thus  opening  new  lines  of  research  on 

dolphins’ sensory world.

SUMMARY OF PAPER 4 

Questions:  In  cetaceans,  both  chemical  senses  (gustation  and  olfaction)  have  not  received 
much research attention. Other marine species such as birds and fishes locate their prey even 
over  great  distances by  using olfactory  cues.  Therefore  we  were wondering whether or not 
dolphins  are  sensitive  to  olfactory  cues,  too.  Are  dolphins  able  to  perceive  food-related 
odours? 

Methods:  We  investigated  the  response  of  the  Planète  Sauvage  dolphins  towards  two 
visually identical experimental devices, with one containing fish and the other being empty. 
As  the  odour  was  in  air,  the  number  of  respirations  close  to  each  device  was  counted  and 
compared between both stimuli (i.e., fish and control). 

Results: Dolphins breathed more often close to the device containing fish than close to the 
empty device. Interestingly, this difference seems to appear not until the fish odour reaches a 
certain intensity.  

Conclusions: Bottlenose dolphins seem to be able to perceive fish using olfactory cues only. 
Therefore, the dolphin’s Merkwelt appears to be richer with regard to chemical stimuli than 
previously suggested.

Abstract 

Odours are used by different phylogenetic groups of aquatic species. Marine birds as well as 
fishes  locate  their  prey  even  over  great  distances  by  using  olfactory  cues.  Surprisingly,  the 
debate remains open when it comes to cetaceans. Some anatomists and geneticists doubt that 
cetaceans can perceive odours. Here, we conducted a behavioural study to test whether or not 
captive dolphins  respond to  a biologically  relevant  smell, the odour of dead fresh  fish. We 
placed  an  odour  source  within  an  opaque  barrel  at  the  border  of  the  pool  and  counted  the 
number of respirations at proximity as an indicator of investigation. Dolphins breathed more 
often close to the odour source than close to a visually identical empty barrel from the second 
day on, i.e. when the fish odour was stronger. Our findings suggest that dolphins were able to 
perceive  fish  using  olfactory  cues  only,  which  sheds  new  light  on  cetaceans’  sensory 
perception of their environment and foraging abilities.

1. 

INTRODUCTION 

The  knowledge  about  the  chemoreceptive  abilities  of  aquatic  species  differs  between 

phylogenetic groups. Studies on tube-nosed seabirds (reviewed in Nevitt 2008) have shown 

that  they  are  able  to  find  their  patchily  distributed  foraging  areas  in  the  open  ocean  over 

thousands  of  square  kilometres  by  using  odours  (Nevitt  et  al.  1995).  Likewise,  another 

marine bird, the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), is attracted by the same odour that 

procellariiformes  use  to  locate  prey,  namely  dimethyl  sulphide  (DMS;  Wright  et  al.  2011), 

which  is  released  by  phytoplankton  when  being  grazed  by  zooplankton  or  others,  thus 

indicating  areas  with  good  foraging  grounds  (Dacey  &  Wakeham  1986).  Odours  can  be 

perceived in water and several marine (Davis et al. 2006; DeBose et al. 2008) and freshwater 

(Hara 2006) fish species are known to use them as foraging cues. Some fish show a specific 

behaviour called “sniffing” or “coughing” to drive water inflow into the olfactory sacs, thus 

increasing the supply for the olfactory epithelium (Nevitt 1991). 

Conversely,  olfaction  has  drawn  little  attention  in  research  on  marine  mammals.  Yet 

pinnipeds  have  been  shown  to  be  sensitive  to  food-related  odours  such  as  DMS 

(Kowalewsky  et  al.  2006)  and  to  use  odours  to  recognize  their  pubs  (Pitcher  et  al.  2011). 

However, the presence or absence of chemoreception in cetaceans is still a debated question. 

Although  dolphins  are  intensively  studied,  the  majority  of  attention  has  been  paid  to  their 

vocal production (reviewed in Janik 2009) and sound perception (reviewed in Mooney et al. 

2012). Other senses have been studied only somewhat, if at all. Several authors assume that 

olfaction is absent in cetaceans based on anatomical and genetic findings. In the nasal cavity 

of  odontocetes  the  cribriform  plate  of  the  ethmoid  bone  and  ethmoturbinals  are  absent 

(Pihlström 2008). The main and accessory olfactory tracts are absent in toothed whales, and 

considerably  reduced  or  absent  in  baleen  whales  (Pihlström  2008;  Oelschläger  2008). 

Furthermore,  olfactory  receptor  genes  are  also  highly  reduced  (pseudogenised)  or  entirely 

absent in Odontoceti (Kishida et al. 2007). 

In  contrast,  other  studies  imply  that  cetaceans  may  be  capable  of  olfaction. 

Chemoreceptor cells were found in the frontal and vestibular sac (close to the blowhole) of 

harbour  porpoises  (Phocoena  phocoena;  Behrmann  1989),  perhaps  enabling  some  kind  of 

odour  sensation.  Odontoceti  were  found  to  possess  a  well-developed  olfactory  tubercle 

(Oelschläger  &  Oelschläger  2009).  In  bowhead  whales  (Balaena  mysticetus)  a  complex 

 

97 

Chapter 4: Chemoreception in dolphins 

olfactory  bulb  and  olfactory  tracts  are  present  and  more  than  half  of  the  olfactory  receptor 

genes are intact, suggesting a functional sense of smell what may enable this species to detect 

its  prey  (Thewissen  et  al.  2011).  Taken  together,  this  second  set  of  studies  suggests  that 

cetaceans  might  have,  to  some  extent,  access  to  chemosensory  information  on  airborne 

odours,  but  as  anatomical  and  genetic  studies  draw  controversial  conclusions,  behavioural 

studies are needed.  

Bottlenose dolphins’ diet is primarily composed of fish (94.2 % in stranded dolphins’ 

stomach contents; Spitz et al. 2006). Among fish, dolphins prefer high-energy density species 

(Spitz et al. 2010) and the largest proportion of daily food intake was found to be fat fish (73-

93  %;  Meynier  et  al.  2008).  Although  it  is  widely  accepted  that  dolphins  use  their 

sophisticated echolocation system for prey location (reviewed in Thomas et al. 2004), it may 

be possible that dolphins also use olfactory cues. We assumed that odours of prey should be 

interesting for the dolphins and predicted that, if dolphins were capable of perceiving it, they 

would express some kind of “sniffing” behaviour, i.e. taking more breaths, within the range 

of the odour source. 

 

 

2.  MATERIAL & METHODS 

2.1.  Study subjects and housing conditions 

In May and June 2013, we studied six captive-born bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops 

truncatus; four males: aged 5, 8, 14, and 29 years; two females: aged 5 and 12 years) in 

the delphinarium of Planète Sauvage (Port-Saint-Père, France). The diet of the dolphins 

was composed of frozen stored squid and fish (herring, capelin, sprat, and whiting) and 

changed in species composition on a daily basis (containing at least three different fish 

species each day). A daily  ration of 5-10 kg per  individual (depending on its  weight) 

was given throughout the day during seven feeding sessions (ca. 15 minutes lasting). 

2.2.  Data collection 

As  odour  source  we  used  one  kilogram  of  mixed  fishes  and  squids  (hereafter 

referred  to  as  “fish”)  that  were  actually  destined  for  feeding  the  dolphins.  Mixing 

species  was  done  to  avoid  responses  biased  by  individual  preferences.  The  fish  was 

defrosted during the night preceding the first day of each one of the three experiment

sections (Figure 1a). Then it was placed in an opaque plastic barrel (26 cm high with 20 

cm diameter; Figure 1b) that was familiar to the dolphins as it was used in a previous 

experiment. The perforated barrel was placed without lid directly at the border of the 

pool,  at  the  same  time  with  a  second,  identical  barrel  that  served  as  control  (i.e.,  not 

containing  any  fish).  Barrels  were  left  for  a  10  minute  session.  Two  video  cameras 

(Sony Handycam HDR-XR 155) filmed on of the barrels each. Videos were analysed 

by  an  observer  who  counted  the  number  of  respirations  for  each  individual  dolphin 

within  a  range  of  2.5  m  around  the  barrels.  Dolphins  were  identified  on  the  basis  of 

physical differences (e.g., shape of the dorsal fin or colour patterns of the skin).

Chapter 4: Chemoreception in dolphins 

The experiment took place in pool 3 (2.2 x 1.8 m; Figure 1c) when the weather 

was  fair.  Both  barrels  were  placed  each  next  to  a  channel  that  connected  to 

experimental  pool  with  a  neighbouring  pool  and  were  attached  to  a  pole  to  prevent 

them from falling in the pool in case of a wave (Figure 1c). The two barrels were 8 m 

away from each other (linear distance) and the position for fish/control barrel changed 

randomly from one session to another. 

We  conducted  two  sessions  per  day,  one  at  midday  and  another  one  in  the 

afternoon and each experimental section lasted three days. Three sections were done in 

total with a new mixture of fish each time, leading to 18 sessions in total over nine days 

(Figure  1a).  During  a  section  the  fish  was  not  stored  in  the  fridge  but  at  room 

temperature in order to intensify the odour. 

 

2.3.  Data analysis 

Statistical  analyses  were  run  using  R  software  (version  2.15.0,  R  Development 

Core Team, www.r-project.org). As odour concentration changed on a daily basis due 

to  fish  decomposition,  we  compared  the  number  of  respirations  between  fish  and 

control for each day separately with Wilcoxon tests (N = 6). Therefore we summed up 

each individual’s values  obtained during the sessions  of the  first,  the second, and the 

third  days,  respectively,  of  the  three  experimental  sections.  Respiration  values  in  the 

text and figure are given as mean ± standard error. 

3.  RESULTS 

Whereas the number of respirations at the first days did not differ significantly between 

the  barrel  containing  fish  and  the  control  barrel  (fish:  6.5  ±  1.6;  control:  11.8  ±  3.1; 

p = 0.0625,  V  =  20,  N  =  6),  the  dolphins  breathed  more  often  in  the  area  around  the  fish-

smelling compared to the control both at the second days (fish: 13.5 ± 1.3; control: 5.5 ± 0.5; 

p = 0.0355, V = 0, N = 6) and even more at the third days (fish: 16.8 ± 1.9; control: 4.8 ± 1.0; 

p = 0.0313, V = 0, N = 6; Figure 2).

4.  DISCUSSION 

The response of the six captive bottlenose dolphins to visually identical but differently 

smelling devices suggests that this species is capable of perceiving odours. The dolphins took 

more breaths close to the fish-smelling device compared to the control device, wherefore we 

hypothesize  that  they  are  chemosensitive.  This  is,  to  our  knowledge,  the  first  study  on 

dolphins’  spontaneous  behavioural  responses  towards  a  potentially  biologically  relevant 

odour.  Other  behavioural  studies  on  dolphins’  chemoreception  are  rare.  They  showed  that 

bottlenose  dolphins  can  detect  the  flavours  sour,  bitter,  salty,  and  sweet  nearly  as  well  as 

humans (Friedl et al. 1990; Nachtigall & Hall 1984). Another study going in line with these 

findings  proposed  the  term  “quasi-olfaction”  to  describe  dolphins’  chemoreception  and 

suggested that it may be mediated by the trigeminal nerve  (Kuznetzov 1990). This nerve is 

very well developed in  dolphins  (Oelschläger 2008).  In humans, trigeminal  perception was 

shown to be necessary to locate an odour (Kleemann et al. 2009).

Chapter 4: Chemoreception in dolphins 

That the dolphins did not discriminate between fish-smelling and control device at the 

first day might be caused by the odour concentration. Perhaps the olfactory sense may not be 

extremely  sensitive  in  dolphins,  especially  as  the  odour  was  in  the  air,  but  requires  certain 

odour strengths that were not yet reached at the first day when the fish was fresh. As the fish 

odour  intensified  over  time,  thus  it  smelled  stronger  compared  to  the  first  day,  dolphins 

responded to it.  

Dolphins  may  also  respond  to  certain  molecules  whose  concentrations  increase 

progressively  in  the  course  of  decomposition,  such  as  putrescine,  trimethylamine,  or  other 

volatile amines (Shakila et al. 2003; Sil et al. 2008). Therefore, the dolphins’ response could 

be  explained  by  an  attraction  to  one  or  several  of  the  molecules  specific  to  the  stage  of 

decomposition  at  the  second  and  third  day.  Although  dolphins  are  primarily  hunting  living 

prey (Reithaus & Dill 2009) there are some reports that dolphins occasionally feed on already 

dead prey (Sumpton et al. 2010). Actually, in some areas, populations of dolphins specialize 

in  taking  fish  baits,  sometimes  minutes  after  baiting.  One  can  therefore  wonder  whether 

olfactory cues, above other cues, may contribute to fast localization (Sumpton et al. 2010). 

Dolphins  may  also  simply  have  responded  to  this  odour  as  a  novel  stimulus  (since 

dolphins living in a delphinarium are exclusively fed fresh  frozen-stored fish). In any case, 

there is certainly room for an adaptive value for this perceptive ability, because living fish, 

the main prey of dolphins, do indeed emit detectable odours (Hirvonen et al. 2000; Kullmann 

et al. 2008; McIntosh & Peckarsky 2004). Different aquatic species (fish, crustaceans, as well 

as insect larvae) respond to the odour of their respective predator fish (Hirvonen et al. 2000; 

Kullmann et al. 2008; McIntosh & Peckarsky 2004), showing that olfactory cues may play an 

important role in predator-prey interactions. In conclusion our results suggest that bottlenose 

dolphins are capable of perceiving odours. Given the fact that this test is easily conducted it 

may  allow to  test free-living dolphins,  for example by using floating odour sources.  To  go 

further towards the idea that dolphins might use olfactory cues to locate prey, their sensitivity 

for DMS should be investigated. This study provides interesting results on odour perception 

in dolphins, thus opening new lines of research on cetaceans’ chemoreception.

SUMMARY OF PAPER 5 

Questions:  Beside  the  five  traditional  senses  (hearing,  sight,  touch,  taste  and  smell),  the 
perception of other cues can provide useful information  about  the environment.  One of the 
less intensively studies senses is magnetoreception. Although some spatial observations and 
anatomical  findings  suggest  that  dolphins  (and  other  cetaceans)  may  be  sensitive  to  the 
geomagnetic field, experimental evidence is lacking. Do dolphins possess a magnetic sense? 
In case they do, will they be attracted to the magnetic stimulus or avoid it instead?  

Methods: We tested the response of the Planète Sauvage dolphins towards an experimental 
device  containing  a  neodymium  block  that  was  either  magnetized  or  demagnetized  but 
otherwise  identical  (form,  density).  Behaviours  analysed  included:  latency  for  the  first 
approach, time spent close to the device, latencies for the first rostrum contact and the first 
body contact, number and duration of rostrum and body contacts. 

Results:  We  found  that  the  dolphins  did  not  differ  significantly  in  latency  for  the  first 
approach, time spent close to the device, number and duration of rostrum and body contacts. 
However, they took more time before touching the magnetized device both with the rostrum 
and with the body. 

Conclusions: Bottlenose dolphins respond differently to a magnetized object compared to a 
visually identical but demagnetized object. It seems that magnetic objects are at least partly 
repellent  for  dolphins  because  they  hesitated  to  touch  it.  Therefore,  this  species  can  be 
considered  as  magnetosensitive  and  magnetic  fields  have  to  be  added  to  the  list  of  stimuli 
that are available for the dolphin to perceive its Umwelt.

Abstract 

Magnetoreception, i.e. the perception of  a magnetic field,  is  supposed to  play  an important 
role  for  orientation  and  navigation  in  some  animals,  including  both  terrestrial  and  aquatic 
species.  Although  some  spatial  observations  of  free-ranging  cetaceans  and  anatomical 
findings  led  to  the  assumption  that  cetaceans  may  be  sensitive  to  the  geomagnetic  field, 
experimental  evidence  is  lacking.  Here  we  tested  the  spontaneous  response  of  six  captive 
bottlenose dolphins  to  the presentation  of two magnetized and demagnetized devices while 
they  were  swimming  freely.  Dolphins  took  more  time  before  touching  the  device  when  it 
contained  a  magnetized  neodymium  block  compared  to  a  control  demagnetized  block  that 
was identical in form and density. We conclude that the dolphins are able to discriminate the 
two  stimuli  on  the  basis  of  their  magnetic  properties,  a  prerequisite  for  magnetoreception-
based  navigation.  This  finding  contributes  to  the  debated  question  of  a  magnetic  sense  in 
cetaceans that could have function in magnetoreception-based navigation.

1. 

INTRODUCTION 

The  geomagnetic field  is a dipole field  generated by the Earth’s  fluid outer iron  core 

(Wiltschko  &  Wiltschko  1995)  providing  a  consistent  source  of  directional  and  latitudinal 

information  on  the  global  scale  (Winklhofer  2010).  Different  taxa  can  detect  this  magnetic 

field,  although  primary  magnetoreceptors  have  not  yet  been  unequivocally  identified 

(Lohmann & Johnson 2000). Birds use geomagnetic cues for navigation, for example during 

homing  and  migration  (Cadiou  &  McNaughton  2010).  Several  insects,  e.g.  bees  and  ants, 

orient  around  their  nests  with  the  aid  of the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  (Wajnberg  et  al.  2010). 

Likewise, some amphibians were found to navigate by using geomagnetic cues (e.g. Diego-

Rasilla  et  al.  2008).  But  also  some  mammals,  e.g.  mole  rats  and  bats,  are  capable  of 

magnetoreception-based orientation (Holland at al. 2006; Marhold et al. 1997). 

Not  only  terrestrial  animals  rely  on  geomagnetic  information,  the  same  is  true  for 

several  marine  species.  The  seafloor  occurs  in  distinct  bands  of  positively  and  negatively 

magnetized rocks that are symmetrically arranged on opposite sides of the mid-ocean ridges, 

thus providing potential navigational cues (Walker & Dennis 2005). Magnetoreception-based 

navigation  has  been  described  for  crustaceans,  fish  and  turtles  (Boles  et  al.  2003;  Kalmijn 

1982; Lohmann et al. 2001). Observations of free-ranging cetaceans show some evidence of 

magnetoreception. Fin whale migration routes (Walker et al. 1992) and live stranding sites of 

offshore  cetaceans  (Kirschvink  et  al.  1986;  Klinowska  1985)  were  found  to  be  correlated 

with the geomagnetic field. 

However, experimental evidence for magnetoreception in cetaceans is lacking. Captive 

bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  were  exposed  to  a  magnetic  field  that  was 

introduced into their pool by an induction coil (magnetic field strength unknown) but did not 

show  any  spontaneous  response  (Bauer  et  al.  1985).  Even  during  a  series  of  conditioning 

experiments using two-choice discrimination and go/no go designs (magnetic field strength: 
3.7x10-5 T) the dolphins did not show any indication of a magnetic discrimination (Bauer et 

al. 1985)  However, Bauer et al. (1985) admitted that “experiments that constrain the subject 

in time and place may be putting significant limits on appropriate orientation”. Therefore we 

conducted an experiment that did neither confine the dolphins spatially to one position as for 

example  during  a  go/no  go  experiment  nor  demand  a  direct  response  as  it  is  the  case  in 

 

111 

conditioning  experiments  as  for  example  in  Bauer  et  al.  (1985),  but  rather  observed  their 

spontaneous reaction towards magnetized and demagnetized devices.

2.  METHODS 

2.1.  Study subjects and housing conditions 

In  January  and  February  2013,  we  studied  six  captive-born  bottlenose  dolphins 

(four  males:  aged  5,  8,  14,  and  29  years;  two  females:  aged  5  and  12  years)  in  the 

delphinarium  of  Planète  Sauvage  (Port-Saint-Père,  France).  Daily  routine  comprised 

seven  training/feeding  sessions  conducted  by  the  dolphin  trainers  including  medical 

training (e.g. acceptance of inspection and palpation  of all parts of the body or  being 

touched  by  medical  equipment)  as  well  as  training  for  public  shows  (e.g.,  jump  on 

command).  During  this  study  Planète  Sauvage  was  closed  due  to  winter  season 

therefore no public shows took place at this time.  

Overall, this outdoor delphinarium consists of four pools, covering 2000 m² water 

surface  and  containing  7.5  million  litres  salt  water.  During  this  study,  water 

temperature ranged from 12.5 to 15.3 °C (mean 14.06 ± 0.13 °C) and salinity from 25.0 

to  26.4  %  (mean  25.54  ±  0.11  %).  The  experiment  took  place  in  a  circular  pool 

(diameter: 20 m; depth: 4.5 m). Animals were free to move in and out during the entire 

experiment. This pool was chosen as it was symmetrical, providing identical conditions 

(i.e.  pool  characteristics  such  as  shape  of  the  pool  walls)  at  every  location  used  to 

install the experimental device. 

 

2.2.  Data collection 

We used a neodymium block (length: 10 cm; width: 10 cm; height: 1.5 cm) with 

a  magnetic-field  strength  of  1.2  T  (Ingeniería  Magnética  Aplicada,  S.L.,  Barcelona, 

Spain; Figure 1) that was placed in an opaque plastic barrel (diameter: 20 cm; height: 

26 cm), which in turn was placed in the water 40 cm from the pool wall at a depth of 

50 cm  by  hanging  from  a  wooden  plank  (covered  with  neoprene  to  avoid  injury)  to 

which  it  was  attached  with  a  cord.  To  allow  water  inflow,  the  barrel  was  perforated 

with  40  small  holes  (diameter:  3  mm)  and  3  larger  holes  (diameter:  1  cm;  2  at  the 

bottom to fix the neodymium block inside and 1 in the lid to attach the cord). Together 

 

112 

Chapter 5: Magnetoreception in dolphins 

with  the neodymium  block a 1 kg plumbum  weight  was  fixed inside the barrel  using 

two plastic cable ties in order to ensure a fast submergence of the device. At the end of 

a  session,  the  device  was  removed  from  the  pool.  The  block  remained  at  the  same 

position  in  the  barrel  during  all  the  experiment,  so  that  polarity  never  changed.  As 

control  stimulus  we  used  the  exact  same  (size  and  density)  but  demagnetized 

neodymium  block  (Ingeniería  Magnética  Aplicada).  During  an  experimental  session, 

only  one  device  was  used,  containing  either  the  magnetized  or  the  demagnetized 

neodymium block, and was installed by a person blind to the content of the barrel.

Magnética  Aplicada, S.L., Barcelona, Spain)  with distance from the neodymium block (length: 10 cm; 
width: 10 cm; height: 1.5 cm; 1.2 T) used in the present study as magnetic stimulus. 

 

As the device was new to the animals, we presented it empty during 51 sessions 

lasting  15  minutes  each  without  any  block  inside  for  habituation  on  the  nine  days 

before  the  experiment  began.  Then,  we  conducted  54  experimental  sessions  (29  with 

the  magnetized  stimulus;  25  with  the  demagnetized  stimulus),  presenting  the  two 

stimuli  in  a  randomized  order.  Location  of  the  device  at  the  pool  was  also  changed 

randomly  between  three  possible  positions  to  avoid  any  influence  of  location. 

 

113 

Chapter 5: Magnetoreception in dolphins 

Experimental sessions took place between the training/feeding sessions, resulting in 1 

to  6  experimental  sessions  per  day  (N  =  13  days  in  total).  An  experimental  session 

lasted  15  minutes  during  which  the  response  of  the  dolphins  was  filmed  by  a  video 

camera (Sony Handycam HDR-XR 155) on a tripod behind the device, thus no person 

was around the pool during the experimental sessions. 

Later,  the  videos  were  analysed  by  an  observer  who  was  able  to  identify  the 

dolphins (on the basis of physical differences, e.g. dorsal fin shape) but was blind to the 

content  of  the  barrel  visible  in  the  video.  Different  behaviours  that  occurred  within  a 

range of 1.5 m around the barrel, defined as the experimental area, were measured or 

counted  for  each  individual  dolphin:  latency  for  the  first  approach  (i.e.,  entering  the 

experimental  area),  time  spent  within  the  experimental  area,  latencies  for  the  first 

rostrum contact and the first body contact (i.e., contact with another part of the body), 

number and duration of rostrum and body contacts. If an individual did not approach or 

touch the device during a session, the session’s total duration (900 seconds) was used 

for statistical analysis on latencies. 

2.3.  Data analysis 

Statistical  analyses  were  run  using  R  software  (version  2.15.0,  R  Development 

Core  Team,  www.r-project.org).  We  compared  all  variables  (approach  latency, 

proximity duration, latencies for first  rostrum  and body  contact,  number  and duration 

of  rostrum  and  body  contacts)  between  magnet  and  control  sessions  with  Wilcoxon 

tests.  Therefore  we  summed  up  each  individual’s  values  obtained  during  magnet  and 

control sessions, respectively. The sums for the magnet sessions have been corrected to 

account for the fact that we had more magnet than control sessions. In the text, values 

 

 

present mean ± standard error. 

3.  RESULTS 

Although  the  dolphins  approached  the  magnetized  and  demagnetized  device  with 

similar latencies (magnet: 9187 ± 2197 sec; control: 9314 ± 1951 sec; p = 0.6875, V = 13) 

and spent similar durations in the presence of both devices (magnet: 657 ± 161 sec; control: 

666  ±  176  sec;  p  =  0.5625,  V  =  14),  they  took  more  time  before  touching  the  magnetized 

 

114 

Chapter 5: Magnetoreception in dolphins 

device  both  with  the  rostrum  (magnet:  19929  ±  2080  sec;  control:  17415  ±  1484  sec; 

p = 0.0313,  V  =  0;  Figure  2)  and  with  the  body  (magnet:  24267  ±  993  sec;  control: 

20301 ± 1087  sec;  p  =  0.0313,  V  =  0;  Figure  2).  However,  neither  number  of  contacts 

differed between magnetized and demagnetized stimulus (rostrum contacts: magnet: 59 ± 23; 

control:  85  ±  34;  p  =  0.2188,  V  =  17;  body  contacts:  magnet:  6  ±  3;  control:  6  ±  3; 

p = 0.7874, V = 9) nor the duration of contacts (rostrum contacts: magnet: 74 ± 37; control: 

96 ± 43; p = 0.3125, V = 16; body contacts: magnet: 10 ± 6; control: 8 ± 4; p = 1, V = 7).

individuals’ sums). Statistical difference is indicated by asterisks (Wilcoxon test; * p ≤ 0.05). 

 

4.  DISCUSSION 

The responses of six captive bottlenose dolphins towards visually identical devices that 

contained either a magnetized or a demagnetized neodymium block suggest that this species 

is  capable  of  perceiving  magnetic  fields.  The  dolphins  took  more  time  to  touch  the  device 

when  it  contained  the  magnetized  neodymium  block  compared  to  the  control  that  was 

identical in form and density, thus they discriminated between the two stimuli. This is, to our 

knowledge, the first experimentally obtained behavioural evidence for a sensibility towards 

magnetic stimuli in cetaceans. 

 

115 

Chapter 5: Magnetoreception in dolphins 

That dolphins can sense magnetic fields was already previously suggested by Stafne & 

Manger  (2004)  who  observed  that  captive  bottlenose  dolphins  in  the  northern  hemisphere 

swim  predominantly  in  counter  clockwise  direction,  while  dolphins  in  the  southern 

hemisphere  swim  predominantly  in  clockwise  direction.  One  reason  why  previous 

experiments failed to detect a response of the dolphins toward magnetized stimuli might be 

the  magnetic  field  strength.  The  magnet  used  in  this  study  (for  details  see  ESM)  created  a 

magnetic field with a strength of approximately 0.150-0.505 T at a distance of 2-5 cm from 

the  magnet,  i.e.  the  minimum  and  maximum  distance  between  the  magnetic  block  and  the 

border  of  the  barrel.  This  means,  when  touching  the  barrel  the  magnetic  field  was  roughly 

4000-13000 times stronger than the magnetic field used in  the conditioning experiments  of 
Bauer et al. (1985). Maybe their magnetic field strength of only 3.7x10-5 T was too weak to 

be detected by the dolphins.  

In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  is  on  average  4.5x10-5  T  strong 

(Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1995) it seems questionable whether or not dolphins’ sensitivity is 

high enough to perceive and use geomagnetic cues for navigation. However, we did not test 

dolphins’  perception  threshold  and  there  are  several  observations  that  found  a  correlation 

between  cetaceans’  occurrence  and  geomagnetic  characteristics  (Kirschvink  et  al.  1986; 

Klinowska 1985; Walker et al. 1992) wherefore this possibility cannot be ruled out. 

Another  possible  function  of  magnetosensitivity  besides  navigation  might  be  prey 

detection.  Although  living  beings  do  not  emit  magnetic  fields,  each  muscle  movement 

generates a bioelectrical field. Sharks are known to detect their prey by using the bioelectric 

fields  generated  by  their  prey’s  movement  (Kalmijn  1971).  As  electric  currents  create  a 

magnetic field, it may be possible that dolphins use magnetoreception to detect prey via the 

magnetic  field  created  by  the  prey’s  electric  impulses.  Passive  electroreception  has  been 

already  proposed  to  be  a  supplementary  sense  to  echolocation  during  benthic  feeding  in 

dolphins (Czech-Damal et al. 2013). 

One possible mechanism to perceive magnetic fields is the presence of ferromagnetic 

particles,  such  as  magnetite,  in  the  organism’s  body.  These  miniature  magnets  align 

themselves in the magnetic field and transmit this information through a connection with the 

central nervous system (Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1995). Magnetite has indeed been found in 

the dura mater of dolphins, thus suggesting that they are capable of magnetoreception (Bauer 

 

116 

Chapter 5: Magnetoreception in dolphins 

et al. 1985; Zoeger et al. 1981). Cetaceans may have inherited this sensory ability from their 

ancestors  because  some  of  the  closely  related  artiodactyls  (Thewissen  et  al.  2009)  are  also 

magnetosensitive. Deer and cattle align their body axes in north-south direction by using the 

geomagnetic field when grazing and resting (Begall et al. 2008).    

Our  results  suggest  that  dolphins,  and  maybe  other  cetacean  species  too,  possess  a 

magnetic  sense.  This  finding  provides  new,  experimentally  obtained  evidence  that  this 

phylogenetical group should be added to the list of magnetosensitive species, broadening the 

evolutionary view on magnetoreception.

1.  WHAT THESE FINDINGS TELL US ABOUT THE DOLPHIN’S UMWELT 

The  results  obtained  during  this  thesis  fill  some  of  the  gaps  that  still  exist  in  the 

knowledge of the dolphin’s Umwelt and therefore contribute to a better understanding of this 

species. With regard to the dolphin’s Merkwelt, i.e. what dolphins perceive, three modalities 

can be added to the list of potentially informative cues. As the experiments conducted have 

shown, dolphins respond to  gustatory, olfactory, and magnetic stimuli, suggesting that they 

are chemo- and magnetosensitive. So far, these modalities have not been considered seriously 

as potentially functional in dolphins. Concerning the dolphin’s  Wirkwelt, i.e. what dolphins 

do,  their  nocturnal  activity  is  more  complex  than  expected  with  temporally  patterned 

choruses.  Moreover,  the  finding  that  dolphins  emitted  vocal  copies  of  sounds  heard  daily 

during special events suggests that their vocal productions may serve as potential indicators 

of  events  or  objects  that  bear  a  meaning  for  the  dolphins.  The  functions  of  the  different 

sensory modalities in dolphins may be diverse and are hereafter outlined for the senses this 

thesis has focused on. The word “function” should be used with caution because it implies a 

goal-directedness. When talking about biological issues this may cause confusion as from the 

evolutionary  point  of  view,  all  living  creatures  are  a  result  of  coincidence  and  benefits. 

Therefore,  the  word  “function”  refers  to  adaption  but  not  to  purpose  and  is  hereafter  used 

with this connotation. 

 

1.1.  Possible functions of audition 

Research on the use of vocalizations has been until now traditionally focused on 

communication (whistles and burst-pulsed sounds) and echolocation (clicks). Acoustic 

communication  signals  are  often  studied  with  respect  to  possible  functions  such  as 

species,  group,  and  individual  recognition,  group  cohesion,  social  behaviour,  or 

foraging  (reviewed 

in  Janik  2009).  Dolphins  may  be  able 

to  discriminate 

heterospecifics by means of their vocalizations (Oswald et al. 2003). Delphinid species 

such as killer whales that live in stable groups rely on group-specific dialects (Ford & 

Fisher 1983), while fission-fusion species like bottlenose dolphins identify conspecifics 

based on their individual-specific whistle contours  (Janik  et al. 2006). These whistles 

are  probably  also  used  to  maintain  group  cohesion  (Janik  &  Slater  1998).  While  no 

context-specificity in whistle type use could be found so far, burst-pulsed sounds seem 

 

123 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

to be more frequent during aggressive interactions (e.g.  Blomqvist & Amundin 2004; 

Connor & Smolker 1996) and a certain call type was found to be food-related, probably 

to  manipulate  prey  (Janik  2000a).  Context  can  influence  whistle  rate,  as  whistle  rate 

increases  during  activities  involving  excitement  such  as  foraging  (Díaz  López  2011; 

Moore  &  Ridgway  1996)  or  dispersion  of  group  members  for  example  during 

socializing (Quick & Janik 2008). 

Without questioning the relevance or validity of these research fields, it may be 

worth extending the research issue by  further considering that dolphins’ vocalizations 

may be seen as expressions of some internal process. For example, bottlenose dolphins 

are thought to encode their level of distress in whistle rate (Caldwell et al. 1990) and 

alteration  of  acoustic  parameters  while  keeping  the  overall  frequency  modulation 

pattern  constant  (Esch  et  al.  2009).  The  findings  detailed  in  Chapter  3  suggest  that 

dolphins may express their needs or the attribution of meaning via vocalizations. The 

observed  nocturnal  chorusing  may  be  the  expression  of  the  need  for  social  cohesion 

that 

in 

turn 

is  manifested 

in 

the  synchronous  behaviours  characteristic  of 

resting/sleeping  dolphins  (Gnone  et  al.  2001;  Goley  1999;  Sekiguchi  &  Kohshima 

2003; Würsig et al. 1994). Würsig et al. (1994) described a behaviour in wild spinner 

dolphins, the so called zig-zag swimming, that occurs in the transition between active 

and  resting  state.  During  this  behaviour  the  dolphins  are  producing  whistle  choruses 

that  are  suggested  to  test  the  other  group  members’  alertness  and  to  strengthen  the 

group cohesion (Würsig et al. 1994). These choruses are thought to be part of a group 

process  of  transition  from  one  behavioural  state  to  another  to  affirm  that  the  group 

members  are  synchronous,  thus  they  serve  in  coordination  what  is  crucial  in  group-

living  species  (Brownlee  &  Norris  1994).  The  chorusing  found  in  the  here  studied 

group  of  captive  bottlenose  dolphins  may  serve  a  similar  function,  wherefore  it 

provides  an  indication  of  the  dolphins’  inner  state.  However,  we  cannot  rule  out  an 

alternative  hypothesis,  namely  that  the  increased  whistle  rate  is  not  functioning  in 

facilitating  group  behaviour  but  rather  a  by-product  of  high  social  activity.  Other 

species that are known for their synchronized sleep behaviour such as roosting birds or 

bats are highly vocal at the roosting sites, what is thought to be a prerequisite to sleep 

(Adret-Hausberger  1982;  Kunz  1982).  In  European  starlings,  peaks  of  vocal  activity 

 

124 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

arise before each wave of departure of a group from the roosting site, suggesting a role 

of vocalization in synchronizing and coordinating departures (Adret-Hausberger 1982; 

Feare 1984; Hausberger et al. 2008). Therefore it seems possible that dolphins also use 

vocalizations to synchronize their group behaviour. 

Beside  overall  whistle  activity,  the  production  of  vocal  copies  is  a  very 

interesting feature of delphinid sound production. The fact that dolphins produce vocal 

copies predominantly in the presence of a certain object that was previously associated 

with the original sound (Hooper et al. 2006) implies that the dolphins have attributed a 

meaning/sense  to  this  object.  Thus,  the  attribution  of  meaning  could  be  indirectly 

explorable through the study of dolphins’ vocalizations, especially their production of 

vocal  copies.  Bottlenose dolphins  are known to  copy individually distinctive whistles 

of  conspecifics  (Janik  &  Slater  1998;  King  et  al.  2013)  and  different  functions  are 

suggested. It seems possible that dolphins use these copies as referential vocal labels in 

order to  address  each other (King & Janik  2013), to  confirm  the reception of another 

individual’s whistle (Janik & Sayigh 2013), or to locate specific individuals (Watwood 

et  al.  2005).  Other  mimicking  species  such  as  songbirds  mostly  copy  environmental 

sounds that are frequent and similar to their own (learning mistake model),  sounds of 

predators  or  aggressive  species  (Batesian  mimicry),  or  sounds  of  heterospecific 

competitors in order to repel them (reviewed in Kelley & Healy 2011). 

As stated earlier, most studies deal with diurnal vocal activity, while we presume 

that  the  copies  of  the  whale  sounds  produced  at  night  by  the  dolphins  in  Planète 

Sauvage  have  been  emitted  during  sleep,  as  indicated  by  the  time  and  the  overall 

behavioural  state  of  the  group.  Therefore  it  seems  possible  that  the  dolphins  were 

maybe “dreaming” of something related to the whale sounds such as the public shows. 

Indeed,  day  events  are  mentally  processed  during  sleep  in  humans,  where  presleep 

stimuli  are  incorporated  into  dream  contents  (Cipolli  et  al.  2004).  This  means,  that 

relevant events that happened during the day, are often rehearsed in the form of dreams 

during  sleep  or  day  dreaming.  Therefore,  these  analyses  may  present  an  original, 

indirect way to evaluate which elements of the environment are perceived and relevant 

(i.e. meaningful) to dolphins. Examples of animals that emit vocalizations during sleep 

are  rare,  because  not  systematically  investigated.  A  maturing  male  Lowe’s  guenon 

 

125 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

(Cercopithecus  campbelli lowei) uttered loud calls, which are usually used by mature 

alpha-males, when he was sleeping (Bertrand in Humphrey 1983). These vocalizations 

occurred  in  a  stage  of  the  sleep  that  resembled  the  dream-intense  REM  sleep  in 

humans,  including  rapid  eye  movements,  sporadic  movements  of  hand  and  feet, 

irregular  respiration,  and  muscular  atony  (Bertrand  in  Humphrey  1983).  Similarly, 

young  horses  (Equus  ferus  przewalski)  have  been  found  to  produce  vocalizations 

characteristic for adult conspecifics during REM sleep but never while awake (Lubrano 

Lavadera  2005).  Taken  together,  vocalizations  seem  to  have  the  potential  to  reveal 

internal  processes  such as  mental  processing of experienced environmental stimuli  or 

events. 

In  addition  to  this  interesting  finding  of  which  sound  of  their  environment 

dolphins copied and the fact that these copies were perhaps emitted while sleeping, the 

fact  that the perception of the auditory template  at  daytime and the production of the 

copies at nighttime are separated by several hours is intriguing. Although the sensory 

and  motor  phases  of  vocal  learning  are  separated  in  a  variety  of  songbird  and  parrot 

species (Pepperberg 1997; Thorpe 1961), this  separation  has  not  been investigated so 

far  in  marine  mammals  that  are  also  able  of  vocal  learning.  The  here  described 

separation  between  auditory  memory  formation  and  spontaneous  vocal  copying  in 

bottlenose  dolphins  is,  to  our  knowledge,  the  first  report  on  this  phenomenon  in  a 

marine  mammal.  Aside  from  the  hypothesis  exposed  above  that  these  copies  may 

present rehearsals of a more global memory of events experienced during the daytime, 

as for example in the form of dreams during sleep in humans (Cipolli et al. 2004), it is 

also  possible  that  dolphins,  like  parrots  or  songbirds,  “practice”  the  production  of  a 

newly  learned  sound  outside  the  “model’s”  presence  (Hausberger  et  al.  1991).  To 

summarize,  the  mechanisms  underlying  vocal  copying  and  therefore  vocal  learning 

remain still unclear and require further investigations.  

 

1.2.  Possible functions of chemoreception 

While  dolphins  use  vocalizations  for  long-range  communication  (Janik  2009), 

short-range  communication  is  also  performed  via  visual  and  tactile  signals  such  as 

postures or touch (Connor et al. 2000; Dudzinski 1996; Dudzinski et al. 2012; Paulos et 

 

126 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

al. 2008). However, when at close contact communication may be complemented with 

chemical  cues.  When  dolphins  are  capable  of  perceiving  different  odours/tastes, 

including urine and faeces (Kuznetzov 1990), it is conceivable that they may use their 

chemosensory abilities to gain information about conspecifics such as sex, identity, or 

reproductive  state,  when  engaged  in  exploratory  behaviours  such  as  “genital 

inspections” (Herzing 1996; Norris & Dohl 1980). 

On the other hand, chemoreception may be useful for the dolphins to locate prey 

or evaluate its quality (e.g. energy content). The results detailed in Chapter 4 indicate 

that bottlenose dolphins  are indeed sensitive to  food-related odours and that  they  can 

discriminate food flavours. Other marine species such as procellariiform birds also use 

olfactory  cues  to  locate  their  patchily  distributed  prey  in  the  ocean  (Nevitt  2008). 

Furthermore,  dolphins  were  found  to  select  preferentially  high-energy  density  prey 

species even though they are less abundant (Spitz et al. 2010). It is not clear whether 

dolphins  identify  them  visually  or  by  means  of  other  modalities.  Anyway,  chemical 

information might be very useful in this context.  As fish emit species-specific odours 

(Hirvonen  et  al.  2000)  it  seems  possible  that  dolphins  could  use  these  cues  to  locate 

some prey species. 

Several anatomic studies suggested that odontocetes do not possess a functional 

olfaction  (e.g.  Pihlström  2008;  Oelschläger  2008).  The  fact  that  a  given  species  is 

microsmatic  (i.e.  has  a  poorly  developed  sense  of  smell)  or  macrosmatic  (i.e.  has  a 

well-developed sense of smell) is often based on anatomical characteristics such as the 

size  of  the  olfactory  bulb  or  the  surface  of  the  olfactory  epithelium,  what  led  to  the 

conclusion  that  primates  are  microsmatic  (reviewed  in  Smith  &  Bhatnagar  2004). 

However,  there  is  evidence  that  some  primate  species  actually  have  an  unexpectedly 

high olfactory sensitivity, which for some substances is comparable or even better than 

the sensitivity of macrosmatic species such as rats or dogs (Laska et al. 2000; Laska & 

Seibt  2002).  Therefore,  generalizations  from  anatomical  characteristics  to  actual 

capacities  may  have  been  over-interpreted  and  should  be  revised.  Small  olfactory 

organs only indicate that a species is not an olfactory specialist but may well have high 

sensitivity to particular relevant odours (Pihlström et al. 2005; Nummela et al. 2013). 

 

127 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

While  the  findings  obtained  in  this  thesis  suggest  that  dolphins  are  indeed 

chemosensitive, the perceptual mechanisms remain still unclear as our data do not give 

information  on  possible  pathways.  It  seems  that  bottlenose  dolphins  possess 

chemoreceptor cells both in the nasal cavity beyond the blowhole as well as in the oral 

cavity, but the inner pathway remains unclear as cranial nerve I, which is transmitting 

the  olfactory  signal  to  the  central  nervous  system  in  terrestrial  mammals  (Thewissen 

2009), seems to vanish during early ontogenesis (Oelschläger & Buhl 1985). However, 

since taste perception is supposed to be mediated rather by cranial nerve V (Kuznetzov 

1990) than by cranial nerve VII as in other mammals, the function of the cranial nerves 

might be generally different in odontocetes hence comparisons with other mammalian 

species might be difficult. 

 

1.3.  Possible functions of electro-/magnetoreception 

Another modality possibly involved in prey detection could be magneto- and/or 

electroreception.  Just  as  sharks  are  sensitive  to  the  bioelectric  impulses  generated  by 

their  prey’s  movements  (Kalmijn  1971),  dolphins  could  use  the  electric  currents 

emitted  by  the  muscles  of  prey  to  detect  it  (Czech-Damal  et  al.  2012).  Although 

echolocation provides also information about items buried in the sediment (Roitblat et 

al.  1995),  passive  electroreception  could  function  as  a  supplementary  sense  to 

echolocation  during  benthic  feeding  (Czech-Damal  et  al.  2013).  This  feeding  style  is 

not  uncommon  in  bottlenose  dolphins  (Heithaus  &  Dill  2009;  Rossbach  &  Herzing 

1997), so it seems plausible that dolphins developed a sensitivity to electric stimuli. As 

electric  currents  create  a  magnetic  field,  it  may  be  possible  that  dolphins  also  use 

magnetoreception  to  detect  prey  via  the  magnetic  field  created  by  the  prey’s  electric 

impulses. Our findings show that dolphins are sensitive to a magnetic field. However, 

whether  and  how  they  use  this  information  requires  further  investigation.  So  far,  the 

pathway  of  magnetoreception  in  general  has  remained  unclear.  Different  potential 

receptors  have  been  discussed  in  the  literature,  including  magnetite-based  receptors 

(Kirschvink  et  al.  1985),  photoreceptors  (Liedvogel  &  Mouritsen  2010;  Ritz  et  al. 

2000),  and  radical-pair  reactions  (Weaver  et  al.  2000).  According  to  the  theory  of 

induction-based perception, another pathway would be the perception of electric fields 

 

128 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

that  are  generated  by  the  magnetic  field  (Wiltschko  &  Wiltschko  1995).  Therefore, 

electroreceptors  could  be  used  to  indirectly  perceive  magnetic  fields.  As  Guiana 

dolphins seem to be capable to perceive electric stimuli via their vibrissal crypts on the 

rostrum  (Czech-Damal  et  al.  2012),  it  seems  possible  that  dolphins  could  use  these 

receptors to indirectly perceive magnetic fields.  

Cetaceans may have inherited their magnetoreceptive ability from their ancestors 

because  some  of  the  closely  related  artiodactyls  (Thewissen  et  al.  2009)  are  also 

magnetosensitive. Deer align their body axes  in  north-south direction  and orient their 

head towards north when grazing and resting (Begall et al. 2008). Magnetic alignment 

is a spontaneous behavioural expression of magnetoreception that appears particularly 

in resting animals when body orientation is not controlled by other factors (Wiltschko 

&  Wiltschko  1995)  but  the  function  remains  unclear.  One  hypothesis  suggests  that 

maintaining  a  symmetric  position  to  the  field  lines  somehow  influences  certain 

physiological processes (Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1995). 

Magnetoreception  is  not  limited  to  a  certain  phylogenetic  group  and  has  been 

found  in  other  mammals  (e.g.  bats  and  some  rodents;  Deutschlander  et  al  2003; 

Holland at al. 2006; Marhold et al. 1997; Oliveriusová et al. 2012), birds (reviewed in 

Cadiou  &  McNaughton  2010;  Wiltschko  &  Wiltschko  2002;  Wiltschko  &  Wiltschko 

2003),  amphibians  (Diego-Rasilla  et  al.  2008;  Fischer  et  al.  2001),  insects  (Banks  & 

Srygley  2003;  Wajnber  et  al.  2010),  lobsters  (Boles  et  al.  2003),  fish  (Kalmijn  1982; 

Quinn 1980), and turtles (Lohmann et al. 2001) where this sense is used in navigation 

and orientation. The common point in all these species is the fact that their habitat does 

not provide many visual landmarks and/or is three-dimensional hence rather complex. 

That is true for dense forest vegetation (deer), nocturnal darkness (bats), underground 

(mole  rats),  air  (bats,  birds),  and  water  (fish,  turtles).  Therefore  it  does  not  seem 

surprising that the habitat  of cetaceans might  have favoured a sensitivity  to  magnetic 

fields.  

 

2.  COMPARING THE UMWELTEN OF DOLPHINS AND OTHERS SPECIES 

Although  evolved  from  a  terrestrial,  deer-like  ancestor  (Thewissen  et  al.  2009), 

dolphins are well adapted to their aquatic lifestyle. One could expect that species living in the 

 

129 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

relatives, such as deer. 

same habitat are similarly adapted to the same conditions. Thus, dolphins could be expected 

to share more similarities with other marine species, such as cuttlefish, than with their closest 

Both  deer  and  cuttlefish  inhabit  visually  restricted  environments  due  respectively  to 

dense  vegetation,  difficult  light  condition,  or  turbidity.  Nevertheless,  or  maybe  therefore, 

both species have highly developed visual systems (Alves et al. 2009; Birgersson et al. 2001; 

Cartron  et  al.  2013;  Mäthger  et  al.  2013;  Shashar  et  al.  1996;  VerCauteren  &  Pipas  2003). 

Although dolphins also possess a good vision (Mass & Supin 2009), it does not seem to play 

a role as important  as in deer or cuttlefish. Deer use vision for example to detect predators 

(D’Angelo et  al.  2008;  Hodgetts  et  al. 1998)  and remain  relatively  silent  except  during  the 

mating  seasons  (Clutton-Brock  1979).  However,  dolphins  are  predators  themselves  except 

for occasional attacks by sharks or orcas (Heithaus & Dill 2009; Weller 2009). Consequently, 

they do not  need to  remain  silent  to  avoid  the attraction of predators,  and  they  can use the 

advantages of acoustic signals for communication in visually restricted habitats. Cuttlefish on 

the  other  hand  use  their  vision  to  detect  prey  (Messenger  1989;  Shashar  et  al.  2000). 

Although dolphins probably use visual cues during prey capture (Heithaus & Dill 2009; Mass 

& Supin 2009), prey location is primarily facilitated by echolocation (Au 2009; Herzing & 

dos Santos 2004), again an acoustic modality. Echolocation enables the exploration of distant 

objects even out of sight and is especially useful while moving fast, something that cuttlefish 

rarely do as they primarily are ambush predators (Shashar et al. 2000). 

Another possible factor favouring acoustic abilities in dolphins is their social life and 

fission-fusion  society.  While  deer  stay  close  together  and  in  visual  contact  with  other  herd 

members when herding (Geist 2009), dolphins disperse much more while swimming. Given 

that  vision in  water  is  extremely  restricted,  dolphins  loose  visual  contact  quite  fast  but  can 

stay in acoustic contact even over longer distances. The idea that acoustic communication is 

favoured in visually restricted habitats has been hypothesized not only for cetaceans (Tyack 

&  Sayigh  1997)  but  also  for  forest-living  species  such  as  birds  or  primates  (Catchpole  & 

Slater 1997; Marler 1965). Although cuttlefish also have to face the poor visual conditions in 

water, they did not develop a long-distance communication channel such as acoustics. This is 

maybe due to their mostly solitary life style where communication with conspecifics is short-

range, mainly with visual displays (Boal et al. 1999). 

 

130 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

Short-range  communication  as  well  as  food  detection  seem  to  be  facilitated  by 

chemical stimuli in both deer and cuttlefish (Boal 1997; Boal & Golden 1999; Lawson et al. 

2001; Mary & Balakrishnan 1984; Tixier et al. 1998). Although not intensively investigated 

until now, chemically mediated communication or prey detection seems possible in dolphins 

too. 

Taken  together,  the  dolphin’s  Umwelt  shares  similarities  with  the  Umwelten  of  an 

inhabitant of a similar habitat and a close relative, but does not resemble one more than the 

other, revealing the importance of phylogeny as  well as habitat. According to their specific 

habitat,  mammalian  species  can  be  grouped  into  “sensory  types”  regarding  hearing,  vision, 

and olfaction. As pointed out by Nummela and colleagues (2013), arboreal mammals tend to 

be  more  visual  than  olfactive,  in  contrast  to  terrestrial  mammals  that  tend  to  be  more 

olfactive  than  visual.  Aerial  and  aquatic  mammals  seem  to  use  both  vision  and  olfaction 

equally,  although  aquatic  species  are  generally  considered  as  less  olfactive  than  terrestrial 

species. While good vision appears to be correlated with good hearing, there seems to be a 

trade-off  between  these  two  senses  and  olfaction  (Nummela  et  al.  2013). Interestingly,  this 

study  also  revealed  a  tendency  that  predator  and  prey  species  often  belong  to  the  same 

sensory type (e.g. reindeer and wolf, zebra and lion, mice and cat) which might indicate an 

“arms  race”  between  prey  and  predator  (Nummela  et  al.  2013).  According  to  this  idea, 

dolphins could be expected to have a similar sensory profile to their prey (fish) and/or their 

predators (sharks), thus chemo- and magnetoreception might be not that surprising. 

 

3.  RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES 

As always in research, one finding raises new questions. For example, to which degree 

dolphins exploit the here described chemo- and magnetoreceptive abilities needs to be further 

investigated.  It  is  conceivable  that  the  perception  of  chemical  stimuli  might  be  useful  in 

nutritional and social contexts. To test these questions, experiments are needed that use, for 

example, food flavours or odours representing different food qualities (e.g. energy content) to 

test  whether  or  not  dolphins  are  able  to  use  chemical  cues  to  choose  high-energy  fish,  for 

example sprat (761 ± 102 kJ/100g; average value from the biochemical analyses of fish used 

as food for the dolphins in Planète Sauvage) over blue whiting (443 ± 71 kJ/100g). Further, 

dolphins’ olfactory sensitivity to dimethyl sulphide (DMS) should be tested with regard to its 

 

131 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

relevance  for  other  marine  species  (e.g.  procellariiform  birds)  that  use  DMS  to  locate  prey 

(Kowalewsky et al. 2006; Nevitt et al. 1995; Wright et al. 2011). 

Additionally,  experiments  using  dolphins’  own  body  flavours  could  shed  light  on 

questions such as whether or not dolphins are able to discriminate familiar from unfamiliar 

individuals,  males  from  females,  or  ovulating  from  non-ovulating/immature  females. 

Excretions, secretions, or skin could be used as stimuli. While the collection of excretion is 

relatively difficult as it dissolves quickly in the water and would require an intensive training 

to  earn  only  very  small  samples  (~1-2  mL  of  urine  at  a  time),  collection  of  skin  samples 

would be very easy. By gently rubbing the dolphin’s skin, for example with a cotton gauze 

pad, cells from the upper skin layer can be collected, requiring only a minimum of training 

(personal observation). Different body parts could be tested and should include the urogenital 

area. Dolphins are often seen “inspecting” this area very closely with their rostrum (personal 

observation),  a  behaviour  also  described  for  wild  dolphins  (Herzing  1996;  Norris  &  Dohl 

1980). 

The  role  of  magnetoreception  in  dolphins  requires  further  studies  too.  Experiments 

with  different  magnetic  field  strengths  should  test  the  detection  threshold  in  dolphins  and 

investigate whether they elicit avoidance behaviour in dolphins. The possible involvement of 

dolphins’ electroreceptors (Czech-Damal et al. 2012) on magnetoreception could be tested by 

covering  the  vibrissal  crypts  with  non-conductive  material.  Furthermore,  the  interaction  of 

echolocation  and  magnetoreception  in  object  location  or  navigation  contexts  should  be 

further  investigated.  Therefore,  dolphins’  echolocation  activity  should  be  recorded  in  the 

presence of magnetized stimuli to see whether or not it is influenced by the presence of the 

magnetic field or its strength. 

But  even  in  the  intensively  studied  field  of  bioacoustics,  further  investigations  are 

necessary. In order to learn more about how dolphins perceive their environment and which 

objects/contexts  are meaningful to  them, a closer study of vocal  copy production would be 

interesting. The same is true for other species known to be capable of vocal copying such as 

orcas  (Foote  et  al.  2006),  elephants  (Poole  et  al.  2005),  orang-utans  (Wich  et  al.  2009), 

parrots  (e.g.  Cruickshank  et  al.  1993),  and  songbirds  (e.g.  Hausberger  et  al.  1991).  With 

respect  to  the  mechanisms  underlying  vocal  copying,  further  investigations  are  required  to 

 

132 

Chapter 6: Discussion 

explain findings such as the separation between auditory memory formation and spontaneous 

vocal copying. 

As  illustrated  by  the  example  of  dolphins,  the  Umwelt  of  a  species  can  be  very 

complex, especially if this species has undergone a drastic environmental change during its 

phylogeny or ontogeny.  With regard to  phylogeny, the return of a terrestrial mammal from 

land to water can be considered a drastic environmental change, which is the case not only 

for cetaceans. The same is true for pinnipeds, sirenians, otters, some rodents (e.g. beavers), 

hippopotami, or platypus. Other species experience such changes during their ontogeny, for 

example if their life cycle is partly aquatic and partly terrestrial. This is the case for several 

amphibians that undergo a metamorphosis from fully aquatic larvae to semi-aquatic adults, or 

some insects such as mayflies whose larvae are aquatic but the imago is a flying insect. All 

these species are potential candidates for interesting studies on Umwelt.       

   

4.  WHAT THESE FINDINGS TELL US ABOUT RESEARCH 

Although it has been intensively studied for decades, many facets of dolphin’s biology 

still  remain  unknown.  Without  doubt,  this  is  partly  due  to  the  difficulties  researchers 

encounter  when  studying  marine  mammals,  especially  in  the  field.  First,  it  requires  a  boat 

and therefore convenient weather conditions. Second, marine mammals are not easy to locate 

and once they are found not easy to follow due to their diving capacities. However, the lack 

of  literature  about  certain  topics  suggests  that  these  topics  have  been  so  far  more  or  less 

ignored. But why? It seems that most attention has been paid to dolphins’ acoustic abilities. 

Unequivocally, dolphins’ acoustic communication system and echolocation abilities are very 

sophisticated and play a  major role in  this species’ biology. On the other hand, researchers 

seem to have leaped to the conclusion that other sensory modalities would necessarily not be 

very well developed and neglected them. This approach is like wearing blinders towards so 

far  not  well  studied  or  unstudied  modalities.  It  therefore  risks  leading  to  simplified  and 

incomplete  knowledge  about  the  whole  subject.  Dolphins  are  only  one  example  for  this 

problem, but the same is probably true for other research subjects. 

Beside  the  idealistic  concern  that  a  subject  might  be  incompletely  studied  because 

some topics are neglected, this approach might also impact conservation and/or management 

issues.  The  possibly  hasty  assumption  that  for  example  one  modality  is  by  far  the  most

important for a species can direct conservation issues accordingly. To stay with the example 

of cetaceans, the fact that many conservation issues deal with anthropogenic noise pollution 

(Bateson  2007),  such  as  military  and  seismic  survey  sonars  (Fernandez  et  al.  2005; 

Goldbogen et al. 2013; Jepsen et al. 2003; Piantadosi & Thalmann 2004; Risch et al. 2012; 

Stone & Tasker 2006; Thompson et al. 2013; Tyack et al. 2011), boat noise (Aguilar Soto et 

al. 2006; Buckstaff 2004; Pirotta et al. 2012), or drilling (Bailey et al. 2010; Richardson et al. 

1990;  Thomas  et  al.  1990),  is  probably  at  least  partly  due  to  research’s  concentration  on 

cetaceans’  acoustic/hearing  abilities. Without  meaning to  deny its  importance, maybe these 

animals also face other potential threads that are unperceived because not yet considered as 

potentially important. Assuming that dolphins use chemical cues for communication and/or 

prey detection, these important  behavioural  tasks  could  be extremely impaired by  chemical 

pollution  that  is  especially  intensive  by  the  coasts  (Kakuschke  et  al.  2010;  Williams  et  al. 

2011).   

We are facing many conservation problems,  especially regarding climate change, and 

powerful measures need to be implemented as fast as possible. These measures are chosen on 

the basis of what is known about a given species. But if research  rushes to conclusions and 

provides  a  simplified  and  probably  incomplete  description  of  a  species’  biology,  these 

measures are likely to be not as appropriate as they should be. Consequently, it is important 

that  research  broadens  the  view  and  remains  unbiased  when  studying  a  topic.  Maybe  the 

integration  of  the  Zen  concept  of  Shoshin  into  science  would  contribute  to  a  more  open-

minded research. Cultivating this concept, also known as “beginner’s mind”, means having 

an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even 

when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would (Koda 2008; Pant 2010).  

“In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few” 

(Suzuki 1970)

INTRODUCTION 

1.  L’Umwelt concept de Jakob von Uexküll 

Résumé 

En  1909,  Jakob  von  Uexküll  a  établi  un  nouveau  concept  et  une  nouvelle 

perspective sur la perception de l’environnement par des êtres vivants : l’Umwelt  qui 

signifie « l’univers subjectif » (Chien 2006). En 1934, il a  reconnu les animaux comme 

étant des sujets et non plus des machines guidées uniquement par des réflexes. 

L’Umwelt d’un sujet est divisé en deux parties formant une entité, le Merkwelt et 

le Wirkwelt (von Uexküll 1909). Le Merkwelt contient tout ce qu’un sujet perçoit et le 

Wirkwelt  tout  ce  qu’un  sujet  fait.  Pour  être  perçu  par  un  sujet,  l’objet  doit  avoir  une 

caractéristique  (Merkmal)  correspondant  à  un  récepteur  du  sujet  (von  Uexküll  1909). 

Le stimulus perçu est ensuite traité dans le cerveau qui va lui attribuer un sens. Ce sens 

peut  varier  en  fonction  du  contexte  ou  de  l’état interne  du  sujet.  La  réaction  du  sujet 

face à l’objet va être différente suivant le sens qui lui sera attribué. Cette boucle fermée 

entre le sujet et l'objet est appelé Funktionskreis (von Uexküll 1934). 

En raison du rôle crucial des récepteurs et des structures de traitement sensoriel, 

l’Umwelt  est  déterminé  par  le  plan  d'organisation  d’une  espèce.  Ainsi,  bien  que 

plusieurs espèces puissent partager le même environnement, chacune va posséder son 

propre  Umwelt,  correspondant  à  ses    capacités  sensorielles  spécifiques.  En  outre,  au 

sein  même  d’une  espèce,  les  individus  ne  partagent  pas  nécessairement  le  même 

Umwelt  en  raison  des  différences  morpho-anatomiques,  causées  par  exemple  par  des 

défauts génétiques ou d'événements au cours de l'ontogenèse (par exemple, un aveugle 

et une personne voyante peuvent partager le même environnement, mais pas le même 

Umwelt).  Par  conséquent,  chaque  individu  a  son  propre  Umwelt  égocentrique  qui  est 

déterminé par le plan d'organisation de l'individu (von Uexküll 1934). 

Bien  que  von  Uexküll  (1909)  admette  que  les  espèces  diffèrent  par  leur 

expérience  basée  sur  la  perception,  il  insiste  sur  leur  égalité  en  ce  qui  concerne  leur 

adaptation.  Selon  lui,  «chaque sujet  animal,  le simple et  le  complexe, sont  également 

adaptés  à  leur  environnement;  un  animal  simple  a  un  Umwelt  simple,  un  animal 

complexe un Umwelt complexe", et aucune espèce ne peut donc être considérée comme 

supérieure à une autre (von Uexküll 1934).

Résumé 

2.  Que sait-on de l’Umwelt des dauphins?  

La famille odontocète des Delphinidae comprend les espèces de cétacés les plus 

étudiées, c'est pourquoi ils présentent un modèle approprié pour la description de leur 

Umwelt.  L'analyse  du  monde  du  dauphin  doit  commencer  par  un  examen  de 

l'information  sensorielle  qui  leur  est  disponible.  Les  dauphins  sont  connus  pour  leurs 

capacités acoustiques et leur système de communication est très bien étudié (revue dans 

Janik  2009).  L’ouïe  est  donc  considérée  comme  la  modalité  sensorielle  la  plus 

importante  (par  exemple  Thewissen  2009)  puisqu’elle  est  impliquée  non  seulement 

dans la communication, mais aussi dans la navigation et la localisation des proies (par 

exemple Mooney et al. 2012). Par conséquence, la majorité des études portent sur des 

questions liées  à l'audition, la production sonore,  l’écholocation et  la communication. 

D'autres  modalités  sensorielles  sont  considérées  comme  moins  importantes  (par 

exemple  Marriott  et  al.  2013)  et  sont  donc  peu  ou  pas  étudiées  pour  cause  de 

compromis  entre  les  modalités  (Nummela  et  al.  2013).  La  capacité  à  percevoir  les 

stimuli  chimiques  est  très  controversée  car  des  études  anatomiques,  moléculaires  et 

comportementales  mènent  à  des  conclusions  peu  claires  et  parfois  contradictoires 

(Friedl et al. 1990; Jiang et al. 2013; Kishida et al. 2007; Kuznetzov 1990; Nachtigall 

&  Hall  1984;  Oelschläger  2008;  Pihlström  2008).  De  même,  l’électro-  et  la 

magnetoréception  n'ont  pas  été  intensivement  étudiées,  mais  certaines  observations 

indiquent une fonctionnalité possible de ces modalités chez les dauphins (Czech-Damal 

et al. 2012; Zoeger et al. 1981). 

 

3.  Questions ouvertes sur l’Umwelt des dauphins  

L'objectif  de  cette  thèse  est  de  contribuer  à  une  meilleure  compréhension  de 

l'Umwelt du dauphin en comblant certaines des lacunes dans les connaissances. Jusqu'à 

présent,  l'Umwelt  du  dauphin  n'a  été  qu’en  partie  décrite,  les  différentes  études  ont 

principalement été menées sur l'audition, la vision et la perception sensitive. Dans ces 

domaines,  l'Umwelt du dauphin est donc relativement bien compris. 

Certains  des  sens  sont  temporellement  indépendants,  ce  qui  signifie  qu'ils  sont 

fonctionnels  à  tout  moment  de  la  journée,  contrairement  à  la  vue  qui  est  limitée  à  la 

journée.  A  cause  de  cette  restriction  visuelle  l'utilisation  de  signaux  acoustiques  est 

 

138 

Résumé 

favorisée et  les  vocalisations  pourraient  différer entre  la nuit  et  le jour. Cependant,  la 

plupart  des  études  sur  le  comportement  vocal  dauphins  ont  été  effectuées  de  jour. 

Contrairement à la plupart des mammifères, les cétacés, en raison de leur sommeil uni-

hémisphérique,  n'ont pas un rythme d'activité diurne  (Lyamin et al. 2008). La nuit ne 

peut  donc  pas  être  considérée  comme  une  période  d’inactivité,  mais  doit  être 

considérée  comme  une  partie  aussi  importante  de  l'Umwelt  du  dauphin  que  le  jour. 

Puisqu’ils  ne  passent  pas  la  nuit  à  dormir,  les  dauphins  peuvent  être  engagés  dans 

différentes  activités  ou  comportements  sociaux  au  cours  de  cette  période.      Compte 

tenu du fait qu'ils sont des animaux  très vocaux, il semble probable que ces activités 

soient  médiées  par  des  vocalisations.  En  outre,  la  nuit  est  le  seul  moment  sans 

intervention  humaine  pour  les  dauphins  en  captivité,  présentant  ainsi  un  moment 

particulier  où  ils  pourraient  exprimer  des  comportements  correspondant  plus  à  leurs 

processus  internes.  Par  conséquent,  une  étude  plus  approfondie  de  l'activité  vocale 

nocturne des dauphins est nécessaire afin de compléter nos connaissances sur l'Umwelt 

du dauphin. Ce questionnement a mené à un premier manuscrit : « Presleep chorusing 

in captive bottlenose dolphins ». 

Concernant la capacité des dauphins à copier des sons de leur environnement, la 

question demeure ouverte : Pourquoi imitent-ils certains sons plutôt que d’autres ? Il a 

été  démontré  que  les  dauphins  produisent  des  imitations  vocales  en  particulier  en 

présence  de  certains  objets  préalablement  associés  au    son  original  (Hooper  et  al. 

2006). Cela implique que ces objets étaient significatifs pour les dauphins. Cela nous a 

conduit à nous demander si la production d’imitations vocales peut être révélateur de la 

significativité du son d'origine ou de l'objet/du  contexte dans lequel le son a été  émis 

(Article 2). Ce questionnement a mené à un second manuscrit : « Do dolphins rehearse 

show-stimuli when at rest? Delayed matching of auditory memory ». 

Le  second  aspect  de  l'Umwelt  du  dauphin  concerne  les  capacités  de  perception 

des différentes modalités. Comme la revue de littérature l’a révélé, le gout, l’odorat, et 

la magnetoréception, bien qu'ils soient des sens potentiellement fonctionnels, n’ont pas 

été  beaucoup  étudiés.  Par  conséquent,  il  existe  un  manque  d'informations  sur  leur 

éventuelle pertinence pour la perception par le dauphin, de son Umwelt. Les dauphins 

sont  entourés  d'une  énorme  quantité  d'informations  chimiques,  exploitées  par  d'autres 

 

139 

Résumé 

espèces  marines  (Hirvonen  et  al.  2000;  Nevitt  et  al.  1995;  Wright  et  al.  2011).  Nous 

avons  donc  voulu  savoir  dans  quelle  mesure  le  dauphin  est  capable  d’utiliser  ces 

informations chimiques  présentes dans  l’environnement.  Des préférences alimentaires 

ayant été rapportées chez cette espèce (Spitz et al. 2010), nous nous sommes demandé 

dans quelle mesure elles pouvaient être guidées par le gout. Ce questionnement a mené 

à un troisième manuscrit :  « Do dolphins perceive flavours? A novel approach to test 

spontaneous preferences ». En outre, chez d’autres espèces marines, il a été montré que 

la localisation des proies est  médiée par des signaux olfactifs. Nous avons donc voulu 

savoir  si  les  dauphins  étaient  également  capables  de  percevoir  les  odeurs    liées  à 

l'alimentation : « Evidence for olfactory perception in dolphins ». 

Outre les cinq sens traditionnels (ouïe, vue, toucher, goût et odorat), la perception 

d'autres indices peuvent également fournir des informations utiles sur l'environnement. 

L’un de ces sens moins étudiés est la magnétoréception. Malgré certaines observations 

spatiales  et  constatations  anatomiques  suggérant    que  les  dauphins  (et  autres  cétacés) 

sont sensibles au champ magnétique terrestre (Kirschvink et al. 1986; Klinowska 1985; 

Walker et al. 1992), il n’existe aucune preuve expérimentale de cette sensibilité. Nous 

avons donc voulu savoir si les dauphins possèdent réellement une capacité de magnéto-

réception :  « Behavioural  evidence  of  magnetoreception 

in  dolphins:  a 

first 

experimental report ». 

 
MÉTHODOLOGIE 

II. 

1. 

Sujets et site d’étude 

Nous avons étudié un groupe de dauphins nés en captivité dans le delphinarium 

de  "Planète  Sauvage"  (Port-Saint-Père,  France).  Le  groupe  étudié  a  toujours  été  

composé de mâles et de femelles non apparentés d’âge variable, mais la composition a 

évolué  au  cours  de  la  thèse  (taille  du  groupe:  4-7;  Figures  1  et  2;  Tableau  1). 

L’installation  est  entièrement  extérieure  et  est  composée  de  quatre  piscines  d’une 

surface totale de 2000 m² et contenant 7,5 millions de litres d'eau salée (Figure 3). 

Tous les dauphins ont été entrainés à un âge précoce à l’aide d’un renforcement 

positif  (conditionnement  opérant),  du  poisson  étant  utilisé  comme  renforçateur 

primaire. Pour les dauphins, une journée type dure de 8 à 19 heure. Elle comprend sept 

 

140 

Résumé 

sessions  de  formation/d'alimentation  et    jusqu'à  quatre  spectacles  publics  (selon  la 

saison). Les sessions de formation durent environ 15 minutes et les spectacles environ 

30 minutes.  Les  sessions  d’entrainement  incluent une partie dédiée  à l’acceptation  de 

soins vétérinaires (inspection et palpation de toutes les parties du corps, être touché par 

un  équipement  médical)  et  une  partie  dédiée  à  la  formation  pour  les  spectacles  (par 

exemple, sauter sur commande). Durant les périodes de temps libre entre deux sessions 

d’entrainement,  des jouets  (par  exemple tapis  de mousse, balle) et des jets  d'eau sont 

mis  à  la  disposition  des  dauphins,  qui  restaient  cependant  libres  de  faire  ce  qu'ils 

voulaient. 

Le  régime  alimentaire  des  dauphins  était  principalement  composé  de  poissons  

(hareng,  capelan,  sprat,  maquereau,  merlan)  et  de  calmar  congelés.  La  qualité  des 

aliments  est  contrôlée  régulièrement  par  des  analyses  biochimiques  réalisées  par  un 

laboratoire  indépendant.  La  composition  des    repas  changeait  quotidiennement,  les 

dauphins  ayant  accès  à  3  espèces  de  poisson  différentes  chaque  jour.  Les  dauphins 

recevaient  quotidiennement  entre  5  et10  kg  de  poisson  par  individu  (selon  la  taille) 

distribués tout au long de la journée pendant les sessions de formation / d'alimentation. 

 
2.  Collecte des données 

2.1.  Enregistrements acoustiques 

Le comportement acoustique des dauphins à Planète Sauvage a été  l’objet 

d’une  étude  précédente  (stage  de  master  2,  Briseño Jaramillo  2009).  Une  partie 

des enregistrements, réalisés au cours de huit nuits (entre 18:00 et 06:00) en Avril 

et Mai 2009 et qui n’avaient pas été utilisés dans l’étude précédente ont servi de 

base  de  données  pour  les  résultats  présentés  ici.  Les  vocalisations  des  dauphins 

ont été enregistrées en semi continu à l’aide de deux hydrophones Nauta SS03-10 

placés sur deux côtés opposés de la piscine 1. Ces hydrophones étaient reliés à un 

enregistreur  Marantz  PMD  670  (fréquence  d'échantillonnage  44.1  kHz; 

résolution: 16 bit; réponse en fréquence: 15-20000 Hz ± 3dB) lui-même connecté 

à  un  ordinateur  Dell  390  où  les  sons  ont  été  enregistrés  en  utilisant  le  logiciel 

ANA  (Richard  et  al.  1991).  En  parallèle  des  enregistrements  acoustiques,  un 

 

141 

observateur  placé  à  côté  de  la  piscine  1  comptait  le  nombre  de  respirations 

Résumé 

(respirations audibles). 

2.2.  Chémoréception 

2.2.1. Gout 

L'étude  sur  le  gouta  été  menée  en  collaboration  avec  le  Pr  Benoist 

Schaal  (Centre  des  Sciences  du  Goût,  UMR  CNRS-Université  de 

Bourgogne  6265). En Janvier et Février 2012, nous avons testé la capacité 

des  dauphins  à  percevoir  les  saveurs.  Pour  cela,  nous  avons  utilisé  des 

glaçons  qui  présentent  une  matrice  appropriée  pour  la  présentation  de 

saveur.  En  effet,  ils  sont  faciles  à  produire  avec  des  saveurs  différentes, 

sont  visuellement  et  tactilement  identiques,  et  très  attractifs  pour  les 

dauphins. Trois saveurs  différentes ont  été utilisées : hareng (242 sessions 

de  10  minutes),  saumon  (199  sessions)  et  crevette  (206  sessions).  Pour  le 

témoin nous avons utilisé des glaçons sans saveur, seulement de l’eau (246 

sessions). 

2.2.2. Olfaction 

L'étude  sur  l’olfaction  a  été  menée  en  collaboration  avec  Aurélie 

Célérier et Silvia Campagna (Centre d’écologie fonctionnelle et évolutive, 

UMR  CNRS-Université  de  Montpellier 5175). En Mai et  Juin  2013, nous 

avons testé la capacité des dauphins à percevoir une odeur. Pour cela, nous 

avons placé un baril en plastique opaque de chaque côté de la piscine  Dans 

un des deux barils, nous avons placé du poisson, tandis que le second baril 

restait  vide 

(témoin ;  Figure  4).  La  position  des  deux  barils 

(témoin/contenant le poisson) était changée de manière aléatoire. Au cours 

des séances de test, les dauphins étaient filmés (Sony Handycam HDR-XR 

155)  pour  éviter  toute  interaction  avec  l’expérimentateur.  Nous  avons 

effectué 18 sessions (durée : 10 minutes). 

2.3.  Magnétoréception 

En  Janvier  et  Février  2013,  nous  avons  testé  la  capacité  des  dauphins  à 

percevoir  un  champ  magnétique.  Pour  cela,  les  barils  en  plastique  utilisés  au 

cours  de  l’expérience  sur  l’olfaction  ont  été  réutilisés.  Cette  fois,  un  bloc  de 

 

142 

Résumé 

néodyme a été placé dans chacun des barils. L’un des blocs était magnétisé tandis 

que  l’autre  ne  l’était  pas.  L’ensemble  du  dispositif  a  ensuite  été  mis  à  l’eau. 

(Figure 5). Les séances ont été filmées avec une caméra vidéo (Sony Handycam 

HDR-XR  155)  sur  un  trépied.  Nous  avons  effectué  29  sessions  (durée :  15 

minutes) avec le bloc magnétisé et 25 sessions avec le bloc démagnétisé. 

 

3.  Analyse des données 

À  l'exception  des  enregistrements  acoustiques,  toutes  les  données  étaient 

disponibles  au  niveau  individuel.  Différents  tests  statistiques  paramétriques  et  non 

paramétriques ont été utilisés pour l’analyse des données. Tous les tests ont été réalisés 

à l’aide du logiciel R (version 2.15.0, R Development Core Team, www.r-project.org). 

3.1.  Enregistrements acoustiques 

Les  sifflements  ont  d’abord  été  classés  visuellement  en  catégories  sur  la 

base  des  modulations  de  fréquence.  Le  nombre  de  sifflements  de  chaque 

catégorie a été compté par tranche de 2h (18:00-20:00, 20:00-22:00, 22:00-00:00, 

00:00-02:00,  02:00-04:00,  et  04:00-06:00)  afin  de  déterminer  le  taux  de 

sifflement  pour  chaque  catégorie  et  chaque  tranche  horaire.  Nous  avons  ensuite 

comparé les taux de sifflement entre les différentes tranches horaires (chi²-tests) 

et  entre  les  différentes  catégories  (GLM).  Nous  avons  également  comparé  ces 

taux entre les différentes catégories de sifflement pour chaque tranche horaire et 

inversement (G-tests).   

Nous avons ensuite étudié l'organisation temporelle des séquences vocales, 

soit une série de sifflements consécutifs du même type au moyen de répétabilité 

de  sifflement  (indiquée  par  un  index  de  séquence  de  sifflement,  WSI)  et 

d’intervalle  inter-sifflement  (IWI).  Les  WSI  et  IWI  ont  été  comparés  entre  les 

périodes  pour  chaque  catégorie  de  sifflement.  Pour  les  WSI,  un  G-test  non 

paramétrique a été utilisé, tandis que les données concernant les IWI ont  permis 

l’utilisation d’un GLM paramétrique. 

L’analyse des enregistrements acoustiques, a permis de mettre en évidence, 

en plus des  sifflements,  des sons inhabituels qui n’avaient jamais été enregistrés 

précédemment chez ces dauphins. Ces sons inhabituels semblaient se rapprocher 

 

143 

Résumé 

plus  des  vocalisations  de  baleine  (diffusés  au  cours  des  spectacles)  qu’on  sons 

émis  traditionnellement  par  les  dauphins.  Afin  d’évaluer  cette  première 

impression,  nous  avons  utilisé  une  analyse  de  fonction  discriminante  sur 

plusieurs  paramètres  de  fréquence  et  de  temps.  Nous  avons  également  effectué 

une  expérience  de  lecture  avec  des  sujets  humains  et  la  classification  des  sons 

(dauphin ou baleine) obtenue a été comparée à l'aide de tests de Wilcoxon. 

3.2.  Chémoréception 

3.2.1. Gout 

Les observations préliminaires ont permis de mettre en évidence le fait que 

les  dauphins  pouvaient  rester  proches  de  l’expérimentateur,  mais  pouvaient 

également s’éloigner jusqu’à être hors de vue. Nous avons donc utilisé le temps 

de  latence  nécessaire  au  dauphin  pour  revenir  près  de  l’expérimentateur  et 

demander un autre glaçon comme mesure de l’intérêt que les animaux portaient 

aux  glaçons  proposés  Les  latences  de  demande  ont  été  comparées  entre  les 

différentes  saveurs à l’aide de  LMM  en  ajoutant  l’identité de l’individu comme 

facteur aléatoire. 

3.2.2.  Olfaction 

Le mode de respiration influence la perception des odorants (Saslow 

2002).  Nous  avons  donc  choisi  de  prendre  en  compte  le  nombre  de 

respiration dans un périmètre de 2,5 m autour des barils comme une mesure 

de  perception  des  odeurs  par  les  dauphins.  Le  nombre  de  respirations 

autour du baril contenant le poisson et autour du baril témoins a été fait à 

l'aide de tests de Wilcoxon. 

3.3.  Magnéto-réception 

Afin de déterminer dans quelle mesure les dauphins percevaient le stimulus 

magnétique, nous  avons  comparé :  la latence de première approche  (entrer dans 

un  périmètre  de  1,5m  autour  du  baril),  le  temps  passé  dans  la  zone  proximale 

(périmètre de 1,5m), la latence de premier contact avec le rostre et la latence de 

premier  contact  avec  le  corps,  le  nombre  et  la  durée  de  ces  différents  contacts 

entre le baril témoin et le baril contenant le stimulus magnétique à l’aide de tests 

de Wilcoxon.

L’UMWELT NOCTURNE DES DAUPHINS: PLUS RICHE QUE PRÉVU 

Résumé 

 

Résumé de l’article 1: 

 “Presleep chorusing in captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)”  

Questions: Du point de vue humain, l'Umwelt diffère entre le jour et la nuit en raison 

d'un rythme d’activité circadien (i.e. être éveillé pendant la journée et dormir pendant la 

nuit).  Les  cétacés  sont  connus  pour  avoir  un  autre  type  de  sommeil  (uni-hémispheric 

contrairement  au  sommeil  bi-hémispheric),  c'est  pourquoi  leur  rythme  d'activité  n'est 

pas  aussi strictement attaché  à  l’alternance jour/nuit. Pourtant,  la nuit est  une période 

particulière  (obscurité,  calme).  Toutefois,  on  en  sait  peu  sur  l'Umwelt  nocturne  des 

dauphins.  Est-ce  qu’il  y  a  une  activité  nocturne,  mesurable  par  le  biais  de  l’activité 

vocale? 

Méthodologie:  Nous  avons  étudié  le  taux  de  sifflement  nocturne  des  dauphins  de 

Planète Sauvage. En outre, le sommeil chez les dauphins étant entre-autres caractérisé 

par  un  taux  de  respiration  faible,  nous  avons  utilisé  le  taux  de  respiration  comme 

indicateur de l'activité physique. 

Résultats:  Nous  avons  constaté  que  la  production  vocale  des  dauphins  a  suivi  une 

tendance temporelle avec deux pics d'activité de sifflement intense (20 h et minuit), qui 

ont  été  suivies  par  une  forte  baisse  d’activité  vocale  et  une  diminution  du  taux  de 

respiration, ressemblant au chorus pré-sommeil chez d'autres espèces. 

Conclusions:  Le  modèle  d'activité  nocturne  des  grands  dauphins  suggère  une 

alternance  entre  des  phases  actives  et  des  phases  plus  calmes.  Bien  qu’il  y  ait 

probablement  des  phases  de  repos  et  de  sommeil  l’activité  vocale  indique  un  rythme 

d'activité  plus  complexe  qu’une  simple  alternance  jour/nuit  probablement  à  cause  du 

sommeil uni-hémispherique. Ainsi, l'Umwelt nocturne des dauphins peut être considéré 

comme plus riche que prévu.

“Do dolphins rehearse show-stimuli when at rest? Delayed matching of auditory memory” 

Résumé de l’article 2: 

Questions: Les dauphins sont connus pour savoir imiter les sons de leur environnement. En 

outre, il a été démontré que les dauphins produisent des imitations vocales en particulier en 

présence de certains objets  ayant été associés avec le son d'origine. Cela implique que ces 

objets  sont  devenus  significatifs  pour  les  dauphins.  Est-il  donc  possible  d'évaluer  la 

significativité  potentielle  d’un  objet  à  partir  des  productions  vocales  des  dauphins?  La 

production  d’imitation  vocale  peut-elle  servir  d’indicateur  de  la  significativité  du  son 

d'origine ou du contexte dans lequel le son a été émis? 

Méthodologie:  Nous  avons  étudié  des  patterns de  vocalisation  inhabituels  des  dauphins  de 

Planète Sauvage en utilisant des paramètres acoustiques (analyse de fonction discriminante) 

et la similitude sonore (expérience de lecture avec des sujets humains). 

Résultats:  Nous  avons  constaté  que 

les  vocalisations 

inhabituelles  des  dauphins 

ressemblaient plus à des vocalisations de baleines qu’aux sifflements des dauphins à la fois 

en  termes  de  paramètres  acoustiques  et  en  ce  qui  concerne  l’évaluation  sonore  par  des 

humains.  Les  vocalisations  de  baleines  font    partie  de  la  bande  sonore  qui  accompagne  les 

spectacles  publics  quotidiens.  Les  premières  imitations  des  vocalisations  de  baleine  ont  été 

enregistrées  au cours des périodes  de  repos  nocturnes  des dauphins les premières semaines 

qui ont suivi l’ajout des vocalisations de baleine dans la bande son des spectacles. L’analyse 

des enregistrements effectués avant l’ajout des vocalisations de baleine  ont montré que les 

imitations n’avaient jamais été émises. 

Conclusions: Cette étude montre qu’il y a une séparation temporelle entre la formation de la 

mémoire auditive et la production d’une imitation vocale chez le dauphin. Il existe peut-être 

également une répétition vocale nocturne des évènements pertinents de la journée. Ainsi, les 

imitations  vocales  peuvent  servir  d'indicateurs  d'événements  ou  d'objets  potentiellement 

pertinents pour les dauphins.

Résumé de l’article 3: 

preferences” 

“Do dolphins perceive flavours? A novel approach to test spontaneous 

Questions:  En  théorie,  les  dauphins  ont  juste  besoin  d'ouvrir  la  bouche  pour  avoir 

accès  à  une  énorme  quantité  d'informations  chimiques  présentes  dans  l'eau  qui  les 

entoure. Cependant, peu de scientifiques se sont intéressés à l’étude du gout chez cette 

espèce.  Comme  les  dauphins  sauvages  et  en  captivité  sont  connus  pour  avoir  des 

préférences alimentaires, nous nous sommes demandé si ces préférences pouvaient être 

guidées par le goût. Les dauphins sont-ils capables de discriminer la nourriture par son 

goût? 

Méthodologie:  Nous  avons  étudié  les  réponses  des  dauphins  de  Planète  Sauvage  en 

présence  de  glaçons  visuellement  et  tactilement  identiques  mais  différant  en  goût 

(hareng,  saumon,  crevettes  et  contrôle).  Comme  les  préférences  ont  été  testées,  nous 

avons  comparé  la  latence  des  dauphins  à  revenir  et  demander  un  autre  glaçon  en 

fonctions de la saveur. 

Résultats: La latence des dauphins à revenir et demander un autre glaçon après avoir 

reçu  un  glaçon  parfumé  au  hareng  ou  au  saumon  était  plus  longue  que  lorsqu’ils 

recevaient un glaçon parfumé à la crevette ou un glaçon sans arôme. 

Conclusions:  Les  dauphins  ont  répondu  différemment  aux  glaçons  en  fonction  des 

différents gouts. Ainsi, ils semblent être en mesure de distinguer la nourriture par son 

goût. Le gout pourrait donc être une modalité jusqu'ici sous-estimé dans le Merkwelt du 

dauphin.

Résumé de l’article 4: 

“Evidence for olfactory perception in dolphins” 

Questions:  Chez  les  cétacés,  la  gustation  et  l’olfaction  sont  deux  sens  chimiques  qui 

ont été très peu étudiés. Certaines espèces ’oiseaux marins et de poissons sont capables 

de localiser leurs proies sur de grandes distances en utilisant les signaux olfactifs. Nous 

nous  sommes  donc  demandé  si  les  dauphins  sont  également  sensibles  aux  signaux 

olfactifs. Les dauphins sont-ils en mesure de percevoir les odeurs liées à l'alimentation? 

Méthodologie: Nous avons étudié la réponse des dauphins de Planète Sauvage envers 

deux  dispositifs  expérimentaux  visuellement  identiques,  l’un  contenant  un  poisson 

l'autre  étant  vide.  Le  nombre  de  respirations  à  proximité  de  chaque  dispositif  a  été 

compté et comparé. 

Résultats:  Les dauphins respirent  plus  souvent  à proximité du dispositif contenant  le 

poisson  qu’à  proximité  du  dispositif  vide.  Fait  intéressant,  cette  différence  ne  semble 

apparaître qu’à partir du moment où l’odeur de poisson atteint une certaine intensité. 

Conclusions: Les dauphins semblent être en mesure de percevoir l’odeur du poisson en 

utilisant  seulement  les  signaux  olfactifs.  Par  conséquent,  le  Merkwelt  du  dauphin 

semble  être  plus  riche  à  l'égard  des  stimuli  chimiques  que  ce  qui  était  suggéré 

précédemment.

INVESTIGATIONS DE LA SENSITIVIÉ DES DAUPHINS CONCERNANT 

D’UN CHAMP MAGNÉTIQUE 

 

Résumé de l’article 5: 

“Behavioural evidence of magnetoreception in dolphins: a first experimental report” 

Questions:  Outre  les  cinq  sens  traditionnels  (ouïe,  vue,  toucher,  goût  et  odorat),  la 

perception d'autres indices peut fournir des informations utiles sur l'environnement. L'un 

des  moins  étudiés  est  la  magnéto-réception.  Bien  que  certaines  observations  spatiales  et 

constatations  anatomiques  suggèrent  que  les  dauphins  (et  autres  cétacés)  peuvent  être 

sensibles au champ magnétique terrestre, il n’en existe aucune preuve expérimentale. Les 

dauphins possèdent-ils un sens magnétique? Dans ce cas sont-ils attirés ou repoussés par 

la stimulation magnétique? 

Méthodologie:  Nous  avons  testé  la  réponse  des  dauphins  de  Planète  Sauvage  à  un 

dispositif  expérimental  contenant  un  bloc  de  néodyme  identique  en  forme  et  en  densité, 

ayant    été  magnétisé  ou  démagnétisé.  Nous  avons  ensuite  analysé  les  comportements 

suivants:  temps  de  latence  pour  la  première  approche,  temps  passé  à  proximité  de 

l'appareil, latences de premier contact avec le rostre / avec le corps, nombre et durée des 

contacts avec le rostre / le corps. 

Résultats: La latence de première approche, le temps passé à proximité du périphérique, 

le  nombre  et  la  durée  des  contacts  avec  le  rostre  ou  le  corps  ne  diffèrent  pas 

significativement  entre le stimulus  magnétisé et  le stimulus  démagnétisé. Cependant,  les 

dauphins ont mis plus de temps à toucher le dispositif magnétisé à la fois avec le rostre et 

avec le corps. 

Conclusions:  Les  dauphins  réagissent  différemment  à  un  objet  magnétisé  et  à  un  objet 

démagnétisé.  Il  semble  que  les  objets  magnétisés  sont  au  moins  partiellement  répulsifs 

pour les dauphins  qui mettent  plus  de temps à le toucher. Par conséquence, cette espèce 

peut être considérée comme capable de percevoir des champs magnétiques et les champs 

magnétiques doivent être ajoutés à la liste des stimuli qu’il peut détecter dans son Umwelt.

DISCUSSION 

1.  QU’EST CE QUE CES RÉSULTATS NOUS DISENT SUR L’UMWELT 

DES DAUPHINS? 

Les résultats obtenus au cours de cette thèse permettent de combler certaines des 

lacunes qui subsistent dans la connaissance de l'Umwelt du dauphin et contribuent ainsi 

à  une  meilleure  compréhension  de  cette  espèce.  En  ce  qui  concerne  le  Merkwelt  du 

dauphin, à savoir ce que les dauphins perçoivent de leur environnement, trois modalités 

peuvent  être  ajoutées  à  la  liste  des  indices  potentiellement  informatifs.  Comme  nos 

expériences  l’ont  montré,  les  dauphins  répondent  aux  stimuli  gustatifs,  olfactifs  et 

magnétique, ce qui suggère qu'ils sont capables de percevoir des stimuli chimiques et 

magnétiques.  Jusqu'ici,  ces  modalités  n’avaient  pas  été  considérées  sérieusement 

comme  potentiellement  fonctionnelles  chez  les  dauphins.  Concernant  le  Wirkwelt  du 

dauphin, à savoir ce que les dauphins font, leur activité nocturne est plus complexe que 

ce qui était suggéré avec des patterns temporels. En outre, nous avons mis en évidence 

le  fait  que  les  dauphins  sont  capables  d’effectuer  des  imitations  vocales  de  sons 

entendus  lors  d'événements  spéciaux  laissant  à  penser  que  leurs  productions  vocales 

peuvent  servir  d'indicateurs  potentiels  d’événements  ou  d’objets  pertinents.  Les  rôles 

des différentes modalités sensorielles chez les dauphins peuvent être nombreux et nous 

avons détaillé ci-dessous ceux des modalités sur lesquelles cette thèse s’est concentrée.  

1.1.  Fonctions possibles de l’audition 

La  recherche  sur  l'utilisation  des  vocalisations  a  été  jusqu'à  présent 

majoritairement  axée  sur  la  communication  (sifflements  et  bruits  d'éclatement 

pulsés) et l'écholocation (clicks). Les signaux de communication acoustiques sont 

souvent  étudiés  en  ce  qui  concerne  d'éventuelles  fonctions  telles  que  la 

reconnaissance de l’espèce, du groupe ou de l’individu, la cohésion du groupe, le 

comportement social, ou la recherche de nourriture (revue dans Janik 2009). Sans 

remettre  en  cause  la  pertinence  ou  la  validité  de  ces  domaines  de  recherche,  il 

peut  être  utile  d'élargir  la  question  en  considérant  que  les  vocalisations  des 

dauphins  peuvent  être  vues  comme  l'expression  d'un  processus  interne.  Par 

exemple,  les  grands  dauphins  sont  connus  pour  encoder  le  niveau  de  détresse 

dans le taux de sifflement (Caldwell et al. 1990) et la modification des paramètres 

 

150 

Résumé 

acoustiques  tout  en  gardant  la  structure  globale  de  modulation  de  fréquence 

constante (Esch  et  al.  2009).  Les  résultats  détaillés  dans  le chapitre 3 suggèrent 

que  les  dauphins  peuvent  exprimer  leurs  besoins  par  des  vocalisations  ou  leur 

attribuer  un  sens.  Le  chorus  nocturne  observée  peut  être  l'expression  de  la 

nécessité  d'une  cohésion  sociale  qui  se  manifeste  dans  les  comportements 

synchrones caractéristiques de repos / sommeil des dauphins (Gnone et al, 2001; 

Goley  1999;  Sekiguchi  &  Kohshima  2003;  Würsig  et  al.  1994).  Würsig  et  al. 

(1994)  ont  décrit  un  comportement  chez  les  dauphins  à  long  bec  sauvages,  que 

l'on appelle « natation en zig-zag », qui se produit pendant la transition entre l'état 

actif et le repos. Lorsqu’ils expriment ce comportement, les dauphins produisent 

des chorus de sifflements qui  semblent avoir pour rôle de tester la vigilance des 

autres  membres  du  groupe et  de  renforcer la cohésion  du  groupe (Würsig et  al. 

1994).  Il  semble  que  ces  chorus  fassent  partie  d'un  processus  de  transition  au 

niveau  du  groupe  d'un  état  comportemental  à  un  autre  afin  d’assurer  une 

synchronisation et donc une coordination entre les membres du groupe ce qui est 

essentiel pour les espèces vivant en groupe (Brownlee & Norris 1994). Le chorus 

mis  en  évidence  dans  le  groupe  de  grands  dauphins  étudié  ici  en  captivité  peut 

remplir  une  fonction  similaire  puisqu’il  donne  une  indication  de  l'état  intérieur 

des  dauphins.  D'autres  espèces  également  connues  pour  leur  comportement  de 

sommeil synchronisé, comme les oiseaux ou les chauves-souris, sont très vocaux 

sur  les  aires  de  repos,  ce  qui  semble  être  un  pré-requis  pour  initier  le  sommeil 

(Adret-Hausberger 1982; Kunz 1982). 

En  dehors  de  la  production  de  sifflements,  l’imitation  vocale  est  une 

caractéristique très  intéressante de la production  sonore des delphinidés.  Le  fait 

que les dauphins produisent des  imitations vocales particulièrement en présence 

de certains objets ayant été associés à son original (Hooper et al. 2006) implique 

que  les  dauphins  ont  attribué  une  signification  ou  un  sens  à  cet  objet.  Ainsi, 

l'attribution  de  sens  pourrait  être  indirectement  explorée  à  travers  l'étude  des 

vocalisations  des  dauphins,  en  particulier  leur  production  d’imitations  vocales. 

Les grands dauphins sont connus pour imiter les sifflements individuels  de leurs 

congénères  (Janik  &  Slater  1998;  King  et  al  2013)  et  différentes  fonctions  sont 

 

151 

Résumé 

proposées.  Il  est  possible  que  les  dauphins  utilisent  ces  imitations  comme  des 

référentiels vocaux afin d’identifier le destinataire de leur message (King & Janik 

2013), pour confirmer la réception du sifflement  d’un individu (Janik & Sayigh 

2013), ou encore pour localiser des individus précis (Watwood et al. 2005). 

Comme  indiqué  précédemment,  la  plupart  des  études  portent  sur  l'activité 

vocale  diurne.  Cependant,  notre  étude  laisse  penser  que  les  imitations  des 

vocalisations  de  baleine  sont  produites  dans  la  nuit  par  les  dauphins  de  Planète 

Sauvage et ont été émises pendant leur sommeil. Il semble donc possible que les 

dauphins  aient  « rêvé »  d’un  événement  lié  aux  sons  de  la  baleine  (i.e.  les 

spectacles  publics).  En  effet,  les  événements  d'une  journée  sont  mentalement 

traités  pendant  le  sommeil  chez  les  humains,  et  les  stimuli  pré-sommeil  sont 

incorporés  dans  le  contenu  du  rêve  (Cipolli  et  al.  2004).  Cela  signifie  que  les 

événements  pertinents  qui  se  sont  produits  au  cours  de  la  journée,  sont  souvent 

répétés  sous  forme  de  rêves  pendant  le  sommeil  ou  le  repos.  Par  conséquent, 

l’analyse  de  ces  productions  vocales  inhabituelles  pendant  le  sommeil  des 

dauphins  peut-être  une  manière  originale,  indirecte  d'évaluer  les  éléments  de 

l'environnement qui sont perçus comme particulièrement pertinents / significatifs 

pour les dauphins. 

En plus de cette conclusion intéressante selon laquelle les dauphins imitent 

les  sons  de  leur  environnement  et  ceci  probablement  pendant  leur  phase  de 

sommeil, la séparation temporelle entre la perception du modèle auditif (pendant 

la  journée)  et  la  production  des  imitations  (au  cours  de  la  nuit)  sont  séparés  de 

plusieurs  heures  est  intrigante.  Bien  que  les  phases  motrices  et  sensorielles  de 

l'apprentissage  vocal  soient  séparées  chez  une  variété  d'oiseaux  chanteurs  et 

d’espèces de perroquets (Pepperberg 1997; Thorpe 1961), cette séparation n'a pas 

été  étudiée  jusqu'à  présent  chez  les  mammifères  marins  qui  sont  également 

capables d'apprentissage vocal. La séparation décrite ici entre la formation de la 

mémoire  auditive  et  la  production  d’imitation  vocale  spontanée  chez  les  grands 

dauphins est, à notre connaissance, le premier rapport sur ce phénomène chez un 

mammifère marin. En dehors de l'hypothèse exposée ci-dessus que les imitations 

vocales  pourraient  être    des  répétitions  d’événements  vécus  au  cours  de  la 

 

152 

Résumé 

journée, par exemple sous forme de rêves pendant le sommeil chez les humains 

(Cipolli  et  al.  2004),  il  est  également  possible  que  les  dauphins,  comme  les 

perroquets ou certains oiseaux chanteurs, « s’exercent » à la production d'un son 

nouvellement  appris  en  dehors  de  la  présence  du  « modèle »  (Hausberger  et  al. 

1991).  Pour  résumer, 

les  mécanismes  sous-jacents  à 

l’imitation  et  à 

l'apprentissage  vocal  restent  méconnus  et  nécessitent  des 

investigations 

complémentaires. 

1.2.  Fonctions possibles de la chémoréception 

Lorsque  deux  individus  sont  spatialement  proches,  la  communication  peut  être 

complétée par des signaux chimiques. Si les dauphins sont capables de percevoir 

différentes odeurs / goûts, y compris l'urine et les fèces (Kuznetsov 1990), il est 

concevable qu'ils puissent utiliser leurs capacités chimiosensorielles pour obtenir 

des  informations  sur  leurs  congénères,  comme  le  sexe,  l'identité  ou  le  statut 

reproducteur, lorsqu'ils effectuent des explorations au niveau des zones génitales 

(Herzing 1996; Norris & Dohl 1980). 

D'autre part, la chimio-réception peut être utile aux dauphins lorsqu’ils cherchent 

à  localiser  leurs  proies  ou  à  évaluer  leur  qualité  (par  exemple  la  teneur  en 

énergie).  En  effet,  les  résultats  détaillés  dans  le  chapitre  4  indiquent  que  les 

dauphins  sont  sensibles  aux  odeurs  liées  à  l'alimentation  et  qu'ils  peuvent 

distinguer les saveurs des aliments. D'autres espèces marines comme les oiseaux 

procellariiformes  utilisent  également  les  signaux  olfactifs  pour  repérer  leurs 

proies inégalement répartie dans l'océan (Nevitt 2008). En outre, il a été montré 

que  les  dauphins  choisissent  préférentiellement  des  proies  de  haute  densité 

énergétique,  même  si  elles  sont  moins  abondantes  (Spitz  et  al.  2010).  Les 

modalités  sensorielles  utilisées  par  les  dauphins  pour  identifier  la  valeur 

énergétique  de  leur  proie  ne  sont  pas  clairement  identifiées.  Quoi  qu'il  en  soit, 

l'information  chimique  pourrait  être  très  utile  dans  ce  contexte.  Comme  les 

poissons  émettent  des  odeurs  spécifiques  (Hirvonen  et  al.  2000),  il  semble 

possible que les dauphins utilisent ces indices pour localiser certaines proies. 

Plusieurs études anatomiques suggèrent que l’olfaction des odontocètes n’est pas 

fonctionnelle (par exemple, Pihlström 2008; Oelschläger 2008). Cependant, il est 

 

153 

Résumé 

possible les conclusions  faites à partir de caractéristiques anatomiques aient été 

sur-interprétées  et  que  leur  généralisation  aux  capacités  sensorielles  réelles  des 

individus  doivent  être  révisées.  Les  petits  organes  olfactifs  peuvent  simplement 

indiquer  que  l’olfaction  n’est  pas  un  des  sens  principaux  de  l'espèce  mais  les 

individus  peuvent  néanmoins  très  bien  avoir  une  sensibilité  élevée  à  odeurs 

particulières pertinentes (Pihlström et al 2005; Nummela et al 2013). 

Bien que les résultats obtenus dans cette thèse suggèrent que les dauphins sont en 

effet  capables  de  percevoir  des  stimuli  chimiques,  les  mécanismes  perceptifs 

restent  peu  clairs  dans  la  mesure  ou  nos  données  ne  permettent  pas  d’identifier  

les voies de communications utilisées. Il semble que les dauphins possèdent des 

récepteurs chimiosensoriels à la fois dans la cavité nasale au-delà de l'évent ainsi 

que dans la cavité buccale, mais les voies internes restent à étudier. 

1.3.  Fonctions possibles de l’électro-/magnétoréception 

Une  autre  modalité  éventuellement  impliqués  dans  la  détection  des  proies 

pourrait  être  la  magnéto  et/ou  l’électro-réception.  Tout  comme  les  requins  sont 

sensibles  aux  impulsions  bioélectriques  générés  par  les  mouvements  de  leurs 

proies  (Kalmijn  1971),  les  dauphins  pourraient  utiliser  les  courants  électriques 

émis  par  les  muscles  de  leurs  proies  (Czech-Damal  et  al.  2012).  Bien  que 

l'écholocation  fournisse  également  des  informations  sur  les  objets  enfouis  dans 

les  sédiments  (Roitblat  et  al.  1995),  l’électro-réception  passive  pourrait 

fonctionner comme un sens supplémentaire à l'écholocation lors de l'alimentation 

benthique (Czech-Damal et al. 2013). Ce style d'alimentation n'est pas rare chez 

les grands dauphins (Heithaus & Dill 2009; Rossbach & Herzing 1997), il semble 

donc  plausible  que  les  dauphins  aient  développé  une  sensibilité  à  des  stimuli 

électriques.  Comme  les  courants  électriques  créent  un champ  magnétique, il  est 

possible  que  les  dauphins  utilisent  également  la  magnéto-réception  afin  de 

détecter ses proies via le champ magnétique créé par des impulsions électriques 

de  leurs  muscles.  Si  nos  résultats  montrent  que  les  dauphins  sont  sensibles  et 

peuvent détecter les champs magnétiques savoir si et comment ils utilisent cette 

information requière une étude plus approfondie. Jusqu'à présent, la voie interne 

utilisées pour la magnéto-réception sont peu connues. Une voie possible serait la 

 

154 

Résumé 

perception  des  champs  électriques  qui  sont  générés  par  le  champ  magnétique 

(Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1995). Par conséquent, les électro-récepteurs pourraient 

être  utilisés  pour  percevoir  indirectement  les  champs  magnétiques.  Comme  les 

dauphins de Guyane semblent être capables de percevoir des stimuli électriques 

via leurs vibrisses sur le rostre (Czech-Damal et al. 2012), il est possible que les 

dauphins  utilisent  ces  récepteurs  pour  percevoir  indirectement  les  champs 

magnétiques.  

 

RECHERCHE 

2.  QU’EST CE QUE CES RÉSULTATS NOUS DISENT SUR LA 

Bien  que  cette  espèce  ait  été  intensivement  étudiée  pendant  des  décennies,  de 

nombreux  aspects  de  la  biologie  des  dauphins  restent  encore  inconnus.  Ceci  est  sans 

aucun  doute  dû  en  partie  aux  difficultés  rencontrées  lors  de  l'étude  des  mammifères 

marins, en particulier en conditions naturelles. Cependant, le manque de littérature sur 

certains  sujets  suggère  que  ces  sujets  ont  été  jusqu'à  présent  plus  ou  moins  négligés. 

Mais pourquoi ? Il semble que l’essentiel des recherches se soient concentrées sur les 

capacités  acoustiques  des  dauphins.  Il  est 

indiscutable  que 

le  système  de 

communication  acoustique  et  les  capacités  d'écholocation  des  dauphins  sont  très 

sophistiqués et jouent un rôle majeur dans la biologie de cette espèce. D'autre part, les 

chercheurs  semblent  avoir  conclus  que  les  autres  modalités  sensorielles  sont 

nécessairement  sous-développées  et  les  ont  donc  négligées.  Cette  approche  revient  à 

porter  des  œillères  et  mène  à  une  connaissance  simplifiée  et  incomplète  de  l’espèce. 

Les dauphins ne sont qu'un exemple de ce problème, mais il est probable que la même 

chose soit vraie pour d'autres sujets d’étude. 

En  plus  de  cette  vision  purement 

idéaliste  (fait  qu’un  sujet  ne  soit 

qu’incomplètement connu car des aspects entiers de sa biologie ont été négligés), cette 

approche  peut  également  influer  sur  les  questions  de  conservation  et  /  ou  de  gestion. 

L'hypothèse hâtive  que telle ou telle modalité est  de loin la plus  importante  pour une 

espèce peut orienter et biaiser les mesures de conservation et de gestion. En effet, peut-

être  que  ces  animaux  sont  également  confrontés  à  d'autres  contraintes  passées 

inaperçues car considérées comme peu importantes. 

 

155 

Résumé 

Si la recherche mène à des conclusions précipitées, la description de la biologie 

de  l'espèce  sera  probablement  simplifiée  et  incomplète.  Par  conséquence,  il  est 

important  que  les  chercheurs  élargissent  leur  champ  d’investigation  et  restent 

impartiaux  lors  de  l’étude  d’un  sujet.  Peut-être  que  l'intégration  du  concept  zen  de 

Shoshin  (1970)  en  sciences  contribuerait  à  une  recherche  plus  ouverte.  Cultiver  ce 

concept,  également  connu  sous  le  terme  “l'esprit  du  débutant”,  c’est-à-dire  garder 

l’esprit ouvert, l'ardeur et l'absence de préjugés lors de l'étude d'un sujet, tout comme le 

ferait  un  débutant,  même  à  un  niveau  avancé  d’étude,  permettrait  de  conserver  une 

recherche plus ouverte (Koda 2008; Pant 2010).

Abstract 

Among  vocal  learners,  some  animal  species  are  known  to  develop  individually  distinctive 
vocalizations, and others clearly learn to produce group signatures. The optimal vocal sharing 
hypothesis  suggests  that  vocal  divergence  and  convergence  are  not  compulsorily  exclusive 
and both can be found at different levels in a given species. Being individually recognizable 
is  socially  important  even  in  species  sharing  vocal  badges.  Acoustic  divergence  is  not 
systematically  controlled  as  it  can  simply  be  due  to  interindividual  morphological 
differences. We tested that hypothesis in a species known to learn their family vocal dialect 
socially:  the  orca  (Orcinus  orca).  We  identified  13  different  call  types,  including  some 
shared by all group members, some shared only by 2 or 3 individuals, and others particular to 
1 individual. Sharing was higher between males than between females. Three of our 4 orcas 
each produced a unique call type, which was preferably emitted. The call types shared by all 
orcas  still  presented  individual  acoustic  distinctiveness  that  could,  to  some  degree,  be 
explained by morphological differences. We found evidence for strong similarities between 
some  of  the  call  types  of  our  captive  orcas  and  the  call  types  of  their  ancestors,  which  are 
Canadian  and  Icelandic  free-ranging  orcas.  Our  findings  suggest  that  captive  orcas  use  a 
complex vocal repertoire enabling each individual to produce sounds that are similar to some 
of their partners’, which might be used as social badges to advertise their preferential bonds, 
as well as individual-specific calls. Our findings open new lines of research concerning the 
functional value of a balanced “diverging – converging” vocal system.

INTRODUCTION 

Some species are capable of vocal learning, that is, they are able to entirely modify the 

acoustic structure of their vocalizations on the basis of auditory input and feedback (Janik & 

Slater  2000).  This  ability  enables  animals  to  either  converge  or  diverge  vocally  with  their 

group mates, two social strategies that at first might appear exclusive. Whereas some species 

seem  to  rely  mainly  on  individually  distinctive  calls  encoding  the  caller’s  identity  (e.g., 

dolphins: Caldwell & Caldwell 1965), other species instead produce calls that are similar to 

all  (e.g.,  bats:  Boughman  1998)  or  to  some  (e.g.,  starlings:  Hausberger  et  al.  1995)  group 

members  advertising  social  preferences.  On  the  one  hand,  being  auditorily  identifiable  is 

socially relevant so that receivers are able to adjust their behavioural response to the identity 

of the interacting partner that is often out of sight (e.g., elephants: Soltis et al. 2005). On the 

other  hand,  sharing  a  vocal  badge  with  others  facilitates  social  bonding  and  consolidates 

group  cohesion  (e.g.,  budgerigars:  Hile  et  al.  2000).  Resident  orcas  fall  into  this  latter 

category.  They  live  in  matrilineal  groups,  which  often  gather  and  form  pods  (Bigg  et  al. 

1990).  Each  pod  possesses  a  dialect  composed  of  pod-specific  calls  (Ford  &  Fisher  1983). 

Thus,  all  members  of  a  pod  use  the  same  repertoire  of  discrete  calls  (Ford  1989).  One  or 

more pods that share parts of their dialect constitute an acoustic clan (Ford 1991; Yurk et al. 

2002).  Similar  dialects  indicate  similar  ancestry  (Barrett-Lennard  2000).  Dialects  and 

acoustic clans  are  also known in  another cetacean, the sperm  whale (Rendell & Whitehead 

2003;  Weilgart  &  Whitehead  1997).  But  both  vocal  convergence  and  divergence  can  be 

found in a given species. In their vocal repertoires, dolphins and starlings, for instance, also 

possess  vocalizations  that  are,  respectively,  mimicries  of  others’  calls  (Tyack  2000;  Tyack 

2008)  and  individually  distinctive  (Gentner  &  Hulse  1998).  In  captive  bottlenose  dolphins, 

whistles  that  are  shared  as  well  as  individually  specific  are  described  (McCowan  &  Reiss 

1995).  The  social  context  of  call  emission  (Janik  2000)  as  well  as  the  social  status  of  the 

caller (Sayigh et al. 2007) determines the level of vocal convergence and divergence in this 

species.  

Producing  individually  distinctive  sounds  is  not  always  controlled  by  the  caller.  In 

animal vocal and nonvocal learners, interindividual acoustic differences can simply be due to 

morphological constraints. For instance, in primates and horses, a large body size predicts a 

long vocal tract able to produce low-pitched sounds and a large lung capacity allowing more 

 

160 

Annex: Vocal behaviour of orcas 

flexibility  in  call  duration  (Ey  et  al.  2007;  Lemasson  et  al.  2009).  Likewise,  body  size  is 

negatively  correlated  with  fundamental  frequency  in  human  males  (Evans  et  al.  2006).  In 

addition, body size is also negatively correlated with echolocation signal frequency in some 

bats  (Stoffberg  et  al.  2011)  and  with  amplitude  in  some  songbirds  (Brumm  2009). 

Individually distinctive voices are commonly found in a large range of taxa (e.g., nonhuman 

primates: Lemasson et al. 2008; Snowdon & Cleveland 1980; ground squirrels: McCowan & 

Hooper  2002;  marmots:  Blumstein  &  Munos  2005;  dogs:  Yin  &  McCowan  2004;  sheep: 

Sèbe et al. 2007; sea lions: Charrier et al. 2009). Morphology plays a crucial role in species 

forming  large  groups  (e.g.,  penguins:  Jouventin  et  al.  1999)  or  living  in  visually  restricted 

habitats  (e.g.,  forest  monkeys:  Price  et  al.  2009)  that  have  difficulties  in  localizing  group 

mates  or  dependent  young  (e.g.,  bats:  Knörnschild  &  von  Helversen  2008).  Despite  those 

strong  morphological  constraints,  some  animals  known  as  nonvocal  learners,  such  as 

nonhuman  primates,  can  still  modify  to  some  extent  the  detailed  acoustic  structure  of  their 

calls and increase the level of vocal convergence or divergence with others. However, not all 

call types in, for example, a monkey repertoire are equally flexible (Lemasson & Hausberger 

2011). Moreover, the context of emission determines the pattern of variability. The fact that 

vocal convergence and divergence can appear in the same species was demonstrated recently 

by different studies in forest guenons. In Campbell’s monkeys, vocal sharing appeared to be 

important  after  a  sudden  change  in  the  group  composition,  whereas  individualism  was 

favored  after  several  months  of  social  stability  (Lemasson  &  Hausberger  2004).  In  Diana 

monkeys, females converge vocally during vocal interactions with other females and diverge 

when calling while traveling in a habitat with poor visibility (Candiotti et al. 2012).  

Based on the previously mentioned examples taken from pure vocal learners as well as 

from nonvocal learners with some ability in acoustic flexibility, it appears that, as predicted 

by  the  optimal  vocal  sharing  hypothesis  (Snowdon  &  Hausberger  1997),  interindividual 

vocal divergence and convergence are not compulsorily exclusive. This hypothesis envisages 

that the vocalizations of species, for which vocal sharing plays  a crucial social role, should 

still  present  a  minimum  of  individual  distinctiveness  to  ensure  identification  of  the  caller. 

Individuals  with a plastic acoustic system can notably increase and/or decrease the level of 

vocal convergence/divergence according to the situation, within the limits imposed by their 

morphoanatomy.  Therefore,  we  investigated  whether  the  optimal  vocal  sharing  hypothesis 

 

161 

Annex: Vocal behaviour of orcas 

could also apply to captive orcas, a species considered capable of vocal learning (Foote et al. 

2006).  To  our  knowledge,  orcas  are  known  to  produce  only  shared  dialects.  As  they 

sometimes travel in areas with reduced luminosity and form complex social societies (Bigg et 

al. 1990), we hypothesized that individual distinctiveness could be found in their repertoires. 

As the repertoire of a given orca usually includes several call types (Ford & Fisher 1983), we 

suspected that this  diversity could  be obtained in two different ways.  First, an orca’s vocal 

repertoire can contain both shared and nonshared vocalizations. Second, acoustic parameters 

of  shared  vocalizations  can  differ  between  individuals,  possibly  due  to  morphological 

differences. 

 

2.  MATERIAL & METHODS 

2.1.  Subjects 

Underwater  vocalizations  of  two  male  (Keto:  14  years  old;  Tekoa:  9  years  old) 

and  two  female  (Kohana:  7  years  old;  Skyla:  5  years  old)  orcas  (Orcinus  orca)  were 

recorded in the captive facility of Loro Parque (Tenerife, Spain) between February and 

May  2009.  They  belonged  to  the  second  generation  of  orcas  that  were  born  under 

human care and descended from Icelandic (Keto, Tekoa, Kohana, and Skyla), Canadian 

resident  (Keto  and  Skyla),  and  transient  (Tekoa)  orcas  (for  relatedness  and  details  of 

morphology see Table 1). All subjects came from SeaWorld parks in the United States 

(males  from  San  Antonio,  Texas;  females  from  Orlando,  Florida)  before  they  were 

brought  together  in  Loro  Parque  in  February  2006.  The  orcas’  Loro  Parque  facility 

consisted  of  three  connected  pools  (with  more  than  21  million  liters;  Figure  1). 

However, as the three pools were being alternated because of maintenance, orcas could 

use only two pools simultaneously during this study. Public presentations and training 

sessions  occurred  five  times  a  day  and  corresponded  to  feeding  times.  The  diet 

primarily comprised herring and capelin. In addition, other fish such as hake, salmon, 

sardine,  and mackerel  were used  as positive reinforcement.  The average  daily  rations 

ranged from 80 kg (Skyla) to 120 kg (Keto). Periodically, body size and weight were 

measured by the orcas’ trainers with tape and scales.

Figure  1:  Diagram  of  the  orcas’  facility  including  pool  dimensions  and  hydrophone  positions.  The 
hydrophone in the  main pool (4) was used for recording group repertoire data; both hydrophones  were 
used to allocate the recorded sounds to an individual when the orcas had access only to holding pool (2) 
and the main pool (4). 

 

 

2.2.  Data collection 

2.2.1. Group repertoire 

During  February  and  March  2009,  underwater  sounds  were  recorded  using 

hydrophones  (ITC-6050C  International  Transducer  Corporation,  Santa  Barbara,  CA) 

built  into  the  walls  of  the  pools  and  connected  to  a  computer  (sample  rate  200  kHz, 

frequency response 20–75000 Hz, resolution 16 bits). A homemade detection software 

(Luke et al. 2010) extracted single sound events automatically in real time and recorded 

them as separate sound files without any possibility of identifying callers. These data 

were used here to assess the general vocal repertoire of the group (i.e., to identify the 

call types used by these orcas). Total recording time was 450 min, enabling a collection 

of  686  sounds  uttered  at  various  times  of  the  day  distributed  randomly  (235  min 

between  6  a.m.  and  2  p.m.,  85  min  between  2  p.m.  and  10  p.m.,  130  min  between 

10 p.m. and 6 a.m.).

2.2.2. Individual repertoires 

During April and May 2009, the vocalizations recorded with the same equipment 

could be confidently ascribed to one given individual. During recordings, trainers were 

absent  and  all  orcas  had  free  access  to  two  connected  pools.  Sounds  were  recorded 

simultaneously  with  two  built-in  hydrophones  (one  per  pool).  With  the  aid  of  a 

localization  algorithm,  developed  by  J.  P.  Luke  especially  for  this  purpose,  the 

vocalizations  could  be  allocated  to  the  pool  in  which  the  sender  was  located.  Every 

time one orca was alone in one pool, vocalizations that were produced at that time in 

that pool could be opportunistically and confidently assigned to this individual. Orcas 

were determined to be alone in one pool by a human observer (DK). 

Thirty  sessions  were  recorded  on  16  different  days  (one  to  three  recording 

sessions per day). The recording sessions occurred at all possible times: in the morning 

(9-10 a.m.; n  = 4), at midday (11 a.m. to 1 p.m.; n = 11), in the afternoon (2-4 p.m.; 

n = 10), and in  the  evening  (5-7 p.m.; n  =  5). Total recording time during  which one 

orca  was  alone  in  one  pool  was  504  min,  enabling  the  collection  of  842  calls.  Orcas 

were entirely free to move and separations of individuals occurred spontaneously and 

voluntarily. 

2.3.  Data analysis 

We collected 1528 vocalizations with sufficient quality (well audible and visible 

in the spectrograms and therefore usable for categorization) during group repertoire and 

individual  repertoire  recordings.  A  large  majority  of  the  vocalizations  (97.4  %)  were 

pulsed calls (Ford 1989). The other vocalizations were whistles (Thomsen et al. 2001), 

which, because of their rarity, were not included in the present analysis. Calls consisted 

mainly of discrete (i.e., stereotyped in overall frequency contour; Ford 1989) acoustic 

structures (74.1 %; individual n values are given in Table 2). The remaining quarter of 

so-called variable calls (Ford 1989) were excluded from our analyses, following Foote 

et al. (2008).

Spectrograms  of  discrete  calls  were  generated  using  a  fast  Fourier  transform 

length  of  4096  samples,  a  90  %  overlap  and  a  Hann  window  function,  with  Signal 

software (Version 4.02.04). As a first step, aiming to classify call types,  we asked 10 

naïve  (inexperienced  in  bioacoustics)  people  to  classify  spectrogram  similarities 

visually (method classically used in cetacean studies; e.g., Sayigh et al. 2007). Each of 

these  naïve  helpers  was  given  a  random  selection  of  220  spectrograms  (with 

standardized  axes),  which  were  numbered  randomly.  The  helpers  were  asked  to 

assemble  the  spectrograms  on  the  basis  of  overall  contour.  They  did  not  receive  any 

advice concerning either the expected number of call types or the number of individual 

orcas. A percentage for each pair of calls was calculated representing the proportion of 

helpers  who  sorted  these  calls  into  the  same  call  type.  This  concordance  between 

helpers (i.e., their level of agreement concerning the allocation of two given calls to the 

same call type) was used as the basis for the classification. The matrix resulting from 

this  human  classification  was  analysed  using  a  hierarchical  cluster  analysis  (method: 

Ward;  measure  of  distance:  square  of  Euclidean  distance)  by  SPSS  for  Windows 

(Version  16.0)  to  identify  the  call  types  classified  by  the  helpers.  To  determine  the 

number  of  call  types  (i.e.,  the  number  of  clusters),  we  used  the  elbow  method 

(Backhaus et al. 2005), in which the squared Euclidean distances are plotted against the 

clusters obtained in the stepwise division of the calls. As a second step, the experienced 

coauthors conducted a deeper investigation based on visual and auditory inspection to 

identify potential call subtypes within some of the call types. 

To  confirm  the  validity  of  this  detailed  classification,  we  analysed  several 

acoustic  measurements  of  all  the  discrete  calls  (n  =  1103).  The  following  parameters 

were  measured  using  the  fundamental  frequency:  duration,  start  and  end  frequency, 

 

166 

Annex: Vocal behaviour of orcas 

minimum  and  maximum  frequency,  bandwidth  (difference  between  minimum  and 

maximum  frequency),  and  maximum  peak  frequency.  All  calls  consisted  of  a  low-

frequency component (LFC; for details see, e.g., Miller & Bain 2000) ranging between 

333 and 1941 Hz (average minimum frequency: 663 Hz; average maximum frequency: 

1041  Hz).  Some  calls  were  composed  of  an  LFC  and  an  additional  high-frequency 

component (HFC), ranging between 1427 and 10821 Hz (average minimum frequency: 

3390  Hz;  average  maximum  frequency:  5805  Hz);  the  HFC  appeared  in  the 

spectrogram  as  a  “whistle-like”  frequency  contour  overlapping  the  LFC  as  it  is 

independently  modulated  (Miller  et  al.  2007)  but  clearly  distinguishable  from  the 

harmonics of the  LFC.  In these cases, the entire vocalization and both  elements were 

measured independently. If a call consisted of a two-part LFC (i.e., it had a visible and 

audible gap that  lasted less  than 0.4 s), the  entire  LFC and both  parts were measured 

separately as well as the gap between the parts (Figure 2 illustrates the different parts 

for the most frequent call type C31, a two-part call with HFC; Figure 3 also indicates 

LFC and HFC for all call types described for this group).

frequency component (LFCb).

Afterward,  a  stepwise  discriminant  function  analysis  (DFA)  was  performed  by 

SPSS  to  identify  factors  important  for  the  classification  using  all  measured  acoustic 

parameters  (except  bandwidth  because  this  parameter  is  dependent  on  minimum  and 

maximum frequency). The vocalizations were divided into the following groups: one-

part calls without HFC, one-part calls with HFC, two-part calls without HFC, and two-

part  calls  with  HFC.  Each  group  was  analysed  separately.  Beforehand,  the  normal 

distribution and homogeneity of variances of the data were analysed. First, a DFA was 

performed  only  with  data  that  met  these  assumptions.  As  these  results  did  not  differ 

significantly from those obtained for DFA with the whole data set (i.e., including data 

that  did  not  meet  the assumptions), we believe that  the results  containing  all data are 

relevant.  Therefore,  all  data  were  included  in  the  present  analyses.  After  the 

classification  of  all  calls,  a  cumulative  discovery  curve  of  the  call  types  found  was 

plotted  to  investigate  whether  a  plateau  was  reached;  this  plateau  can  be  seen  as  an 

indicator of how complete the recorded repertoire was (Samarra et al. 2010). 

As  a  third  step,  we  calculated  the  percentage  of  each  call  type  emitted  by  each 

subject.  G  tests  then  compared  individual  call  repertoires.  DFA  revealed  differences 

between individuals of shared call types’ acoustic parameters. Furthermore, Spearman 

correlations  evaluated  relationships  between  acoustic  parameters  and  morphology  of 

emitters for the call types  shared by all individuals. As body length  and body weight 

are  significantly  correlated  with  age  (for  each,  Spearman  rs  =  1.00,  p  =  0.01),  we 

investigated correlations between acoustic parameters and age. 

As a last step, we compared the call types identified here visually with call types 

of free-ranging orcas in British Columbia, Canada (Ford 1987), and in eastern Iceland 

(Moore  et  al.  1988),  that  is,  from  where  our  subjects’  ancestors  originated.  When 

available, we also compared acoustic parameters. 

 

3.  RESULTS 

3.1.  Call classification 

 

 

168 

The call repertoire of our orca group appeared to be composed of 13 stereotyped 

acoustic structures (see Figure 3 and Table 3).

LFCb:  second  part;  HFC:  high-frequency  component.  Arrows  indicate  the  start  and  end  of  the 
corresponding element. 

 

Following  the  hierarchical  cluster  analysis  and  the  elbow  method,  based  on  the 

judgment of naïve people, eight call types (named C1 to C8) could be identified. Call 

types were classified according to their acoustic structure, that is, the overall frequency 

modulation  pattern,  consisting  of  one  or  two  LFC  parts,  with  or  without  an  HFC.  A 

more detailed investigation led us to subdivide three of these call types into two (C3) or 

three (C2 and C7) subtypes (named CX1 to CX3, with X being the call type number). 

C21  is  shorter  in  duration  and  generally  lower  in  frequency  than  the  two  other 

subtypes,  whereas  C23  is  generally  higher  pitched  than  C22.  Acoustic  patterns  differ 

between  C31  and  C32,  whereas  C31  is  a  two-part  call  containing  an  HFC,  C32  is  a 

one-part call without HFC and is lower pitched. LFCs of C72 are shorter than those of 

C71  and  C73  and  their  frequency  modulations  differ.  The  LFC  of  C73  is  longer  in 

duration, with a higher maximum frequency, although in general the frequency is lower 

than that of C71.

A  DFA  based  on  acoustic  measurements  confirmed  the  pertinence  of  our 

classification  into  13  stereotyped  acoustic  structures.  The  percentage  of  correctly 

classified  calls  was  higher  than  expected  by  chance  (>  95  %  in  all  comparisons;  see 

Figure 4 and Table 4). The cumulative discovery curve of the call types corresponding 

to the repertoire of this group reached its plateau at 13 call types after around 100 calls 

analysed (see Figure 5). 

 

 
Figure 4: Scatter plot of the Discriminant Function Analyses comparing several acoustic parameters of 
different  call  types  emitted  by  the  Loro  Parque’s  orcas.  Each  small  symbol  represents  a  call;  type  of 
symbol  varies  with  call  type.  Black  squares  (with  white  border  and  cross):  group  means.  a)  One-part 
calls: discriminant function 1 is correlated to minimum frequency; discriminant function 2 is correlated 
to  duration.  b)  One-part  calls  with  HFC  (high-frequency  component):  discriminant  function  1  is 
correlated  to  maximum  frequency  of  HFC;  discriminant  function  2  is  correlated  to  end  frequency  of 
HFC. c) Two-part calls with HFC: discriminant function 1 is correlated to minimum frequency of LFCb 
(second low-frequency component of a two-part call); discriminant function 2 is correlated to minimum 
frequency of HFC.  As call type  C6 is the  only call type belonging to the  two-part-call  group, it is  not 
represented within a scatter plot.

3.2.  Individual call repertoires and call rates 

Individual  call  repertoires  presented  important  variations  (number  of  calls  with 

identified  individual:  695;  see  Table  5).  Twelve  of  the  13  call  types  (i.e.,  excluding 

C23)  identified  in  the  group  analysis  could  be  identified  in  the  individual  analyses. 

Four of the 12 call types were shared by all four orcas (C1,  C31, C32, and C5). Two 

call types (C21 and C22) were shared only by the two males, whereas females did not 

have  their  own  call  structure.  Nevertheless,  each  female  individually  shared  one 

additional call type with both males (Kohana C4, Skyla C6). The degree of sharing was 

higher  between  males  (eight  call  types)  than  between  females  (four  call  types).  In 

addition, four call types were individual-specific; in other words, they were produced 

by only one particular individual (Tekoa C71 and C72; Kohana C8; Skyla C73). Only 

Keto,  who  presented  the  highest  call  rate,  did  not  emit  his  own  particular  call  (see 

Table 5). 

 

172 

Annex: Vocal behaviour of orcas 

It is interesting that each individual used one call structure preferentially, which 

for  Tekoa,  Kohana,  and  Skyla  was  their  individual-specific  call  (G  test  per  column, 

Table  5).  We  also  found  individual  preferences  for  six  of  the  eight  shared  call  types, 

preferentially uttered by males (G test per row;  Keto C31 and C32; Tekoa C21, C22, 

C4, and C6).

3.3.  Individual differences in acoustic parameters 

Individual acoustic distinctiveness could be detected significantly for the four call 

types shared by all orcas (C1, C31, C32, and C5; DFA: correctly classified > 89 % for 

all  call  types;  see  Table  6).  Some  individual  differences  could  be  explained  by 

morphological  differences  as  body  length  and  weight  continued  to  increase  with  age 

(see  Table  7).  The  end  frequency  of  C1  (HFC  part)  was  significantly  higher  the 

younger (and thus, smaller and lighter) the individual. Also, the bandwidth of C32 was 

significantly  wider  the  younger  the  individual.  Duration  of  C5  was  negatively 

correlated with age.

3.4.  Comparison with free-ranging orcas 

Some of the call types described in this study showed similarities with call types 

of Canadian and Icelandic free-ranging orcas, that is, the ancestors of our subjects (see 

Figure 6). The C1s we recorded resemble the frequency contour of N7i that is part of 

the  northern  resident  orcas’  repertoire.  Their  average  durations  are  similar:  579  ms 

(total duration of C1, LFC and HFC; n = 147) and 570 ms (N7i; n = 27). The C8s we 

recorded resemble the frequency contour of S44 (southern residents’ repertoire). Their 

average  durations  are  similar:  554  ms  (C8;  n    14)  and  447  ms  (S44  without  part  1; 

n = 29).  C5  presents  similarities  with  the  frequency  contour  of  I7  that  is  part  of  the 

eastern  Icelandic  orcas’  repertoire.  According  to  the  spectrogram,  their  pulse  rates 

differ slightly. C6 resembles the frequency contour of I19 to some extent. However, the 

duration of I19 is clearly longer than in C6. It is interesting that all our orcas produced 

calls with structures resembling those of both Canadian and Icelandic orcas. 

4.  DISCUSSION 

The vocal repertoire data we collected for four captive orcas support the optimal vocal 

sharing hypothesis proposed by Snowdon  and Hausberger (1997). Vocal  sharing as well as 

individual acoustic distinctiveness could be identified when looking both at the call repertoire 

compositions and the acoustic parameters of the shared call types. Our data analyses involved 

only four captive orcas and, therefore, must be interpreted and compared with data for orcas 

in  their  natural  habitat  with  caution.  Nevertheless,  we  believe  the  results  we  obtained  are 

important because studies investigating the individual vocal repertoires of orcas are rare. It is 

indeed  very  difficult  to  identify  emitters  and  their  corresponding  behaviour  in  the  wild. 

Moreover, the basic characteristics of the repertoires we describe here agree with those found 

for  wild  resident  orcas  as  they  contain  the  same  types  of  vocalizations  (clicks,  whistles,  as 

well  as  variable  and  discrete  calls)  in  similar  proportions  with  a  majority  of  discrete  calls 

(Thomsen 1999). Also, the total repertoire size of the test group recorded (N = 13) is within 

the  range  of  repertoire  sizes  reported  for  wild  groups  of  orcas  (7-17  calls  per  pod;  Ford  & 

Fisher 1983).

Vocal  resemblance  seems  to  have  played  a  key  role  in  structuring  our  captive  orcas’ 

vocal repertoires as most of the call types identified were shared by at least two individuals. 

The  present  study  shows  that  the  establishment  of  a  group  dialect  does  not  seem  to  be  the 

unique rule as  several  call types  were shared by  only two or three individuals.  Rather than 

genetic proximity or past life history, sex appears to be a determining key factor to explain 

vocal-sharing patterns. In particular, our two males presented the highest degree of sharing, 

including some exclusive call types, a fact that cannot be explained by their past life history: 

 

176 

Annex: Vocal behaviour of orcas 

First,  the  males  do  not  have  the  same  parents  from  which  they  could  learn  the  same  calls; 

second,  both  males  and  females  had  spent  the  same  amount  of  time  together  before  they 

came  to  the  current  facility  (see  Table  1).  These  findings  are  supported  by  Crance  (2008), 

who reported that captive male orcas showed higher call matching and stronger convergence 

of  their  vocal  repertoires  than  the  females,  which  kept  their  repertoires  stable.  Overall,  the 

repertoire  similarity  was  contingent  on  social  association:  The  more  often  two  individuals 

associate, the more similar their repertoires are (Crance 2008). For instance, wild bottlenose 

dolphin males forming coalitions engage in vocal sharing (Watwood et al. 2004) and whistle 

convergence (Smolker & Pepper 1999). 

Our group was formed 3 years before the study started and half of the call types were 

shared  by  the  four  subjects.  Because  no  prior  recordings  were  available  of  these  four 

individuals  before  they  were  placed  together  in  this  facility  or  of  their  parents  or  previous 

pool mates, it was not possible for us to reconstruct their vocal ontogeny. We cannot totally 

rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  four  orcas  shared  the  corresponding  call  types  even  before 

they were placed together in the current facility by learning them from other individuals and 

not from one another. Even if they did, the fact that they were still using them is interesting 

and indicates the social relevance of these shared call types.  However, an argument  can be 

made to support vocal learning as the underlying mechanism as learning is known to be the 

major  factor  behind  acoustical  development  in  this  species  (Riesch  et  al.  2005).  Orcas  are 

capable of vocal learning in less than 3 years, as a young isolated orca learned to produce sea 

lions’  calls  in  less  than  2  years  (Foote  et  al.  2006).  Similarly,  captive  bottlenose  dolphins 

learned  to  mimic  humpback  whale  calls  within  2  months  (Kremers  et  al.  2011).  Also, 

Watwood et al. (2004) suggested that delphinids (adult male bottlenose dolphins) would be 

able to modify their vocalizations as a consequence of changing social relationships. 

It  is  interesting  that,  although  orcas  are  definitively  capable  of  acoustic  plasticity,  as 

individuals involved in a vocal interaction acoustically match one another’s sounds (Miller et 

al. 2004), some of the sounds used by our captive orcas resembled call types recorded in the 

wild in the 1980s. Thus, some call types of the Icelandic and Canadian ancestors might have 

been  passed  from  generation  to  generation  in  captivity.  This  would  also  suggest  that  orca 

acoustics are based on a “sustainable” system conserving the same acoustic structures for a 

long  time  when  there  is  no  need  to  create  new  ones.  Here,  the  blood  origin  (Icelandic  vs. 

 

177 

Annex: Vocal behaviour of orcas 

Canadian)  of  our  orcas  did  not  explain  the  degree  of  similarity  with  wild  structures. 

Unexpectedly,  the  call  type  found  in  Loro  Parque  (C8)  similar  to  a  call  type  from  the 

southern resident orcas’ repertoire (S44) was uniquely emitted by Kohana. However, she is 

not  even  distantly  related  to  a  member  of  the  southern  resident  community,  but  to  the 

Icelandic population. A possible way to explain why Kohana emitted a call similar to one of 

the southern residents could be vocal learning. Because her mother, Takara, had spent several 

years with a member of the southern resident community, Takara could possibly have learned 

vocalizations  from  him  and  passed  them  to  Kohana.  Likewise,  the  northern  resident  orcas’ 

call  type  (N7i)  similar  to  the  C1  described  here  could  have  been  learned  by  Tekoa  and 

Kohana from another individual that, in turn, learned it from a northern resident orca. Keto 

and Skyla  might  have learned this  call type directly, as  they spent,  respectively,  13 and 23 

months  with  a  member  of  the  northern  resident  community  in  a  previous  facility.  There  is 

some  long-term  evidence  showing  that  acoustic  structures  can  be  preserved  or  slightly 

modified  with  time  (orcas:  Deecke  et  al.  2000;  dolphins:  Sayigh  et  al.  2007).  Ford  (1991) 

reported that repertoires of wild orcas can persist with little change for more than 25 years. 

Besides  vocal  sharing,  individual  acoustic  distinctiveness  was  also  important  in  our 

captive  group. We found that three of the four studied orcas displayed their own  call type. 

This  was  not  due  to  a  recording  bias  as  the  subject  with  the  highest  call  rate  emitted  no 

individual-specific  calls  (Keto).  The  fact  that  the  individual-specific  calls  were  the  sounds 

emitted  preferentially  implies  their  socially  relevant  function.  Nevertheless,  we  cannot 

exclude  the  possibility  that,  to  identify  emitters,  we  had  to  record  sounds  uttered  in  social 

isolation,  which  might  have  led  us  to  overestimate  the  rate  of  individual-specific  calls. 

Likewise,  the  rate  of  wild  orcas’  individual-specific  calls  might  have  been  underestimated. 

Therefore, this debate may be resolved only after more studies are performed that compare 

wild  and  captive  individuals.  These  individual-specific  calls  could  possibly  be  actually 

group-specific calls of the families that the individuals belong to or originate from. A group-

specific dialect is thought to convey group identity and affiliation (Ford 1991) and may play 

a  function  in  kin  recognition  (Deecke  1998).  A  clarification  concerning  this  matter  would 

require analysing the whole population of orcas that they had met previously during their life. 

Apart from the individual-specific call types, we found acoustic differences in the call 

types shared by all individuals, supporting previous findings that individual orcas producing 

 

178 

Annex: Vocal behaviour of orcas 

the same call type can be discriminated by computer methods (Brown et al; 2010; Gaetz et al. 

1993;  Nousek  et  al.  2006).  Although  we  did  not  perform  the  playback  experiments  that 

would  be  necessary  to  confirm  the  biological  relevance  of  this  degree  of  variability,  it  is 

likely  that  animals  can  perceive  these  acoustic  differences  and  identify  callers  even  for 

shared  call  types.  As  a  first  approach,  Filatova  et  al.  (2011)  demonstrated  that  orcas  react 

differently  to  playbacks  of  calls  from  their  own  and  from  other  pods.  Captive  bottlenose 

dolphins  produce  a  shared  whistle  type  (McCowan  &  Reiss  1997)  that  contains  subtle 

variations in contour, called signature information (McCowan & Reiss 2001). 

Individual differences in vocalizations might be due to morphological constraints. This 

effect  was  described  for  cetaceans,  as  species  with  different  constitution  produce  different 

frequencies  (Wang  et  al.  1995).  Evidence  suggests  a  linear  relationship  between  body  size 

and vocalization wavelength in cetaceans (Matthews et al. 1999). We found that the heavier, 

the  larger,  and  the  older  our  orcas  were,  the  lower  pitched  their  voices  were;  this  certainly 

reflects  morphoanatomical  maturational  changes  common  in  many  species  (Fletcher  et  al. 

1992). Because both males were heavier, larger, and older than both females, sex might also 

influence vocalizations, as in wild orcas (Miller et al. 2007). 

Different  interpretations  of  our  present  findings  are  possible;  we  outline  them  below 

with regard to the mechanisms that might underlie the vocal development. First, orcas could 

learn their vocal repertoire at a young age from their family members and thereafter it would 

remain  stable  lifelong.  Accordingly,  the  existence  of  shared  call  types  could  only  be 

explained by a common ancestor from whom the individuals learned this call type at a young 

age.  The  individual-specific  call  types  described  here  would  in  fact  be  group-specific  calls 

shared  with  group  members  not  present  in  the  current  facility.  However,  if  this  were  true, 

individuals born from the same mother and growing up with her for at least 2 years (Keto and 

Skyla)  should  share  more  call  types  than  the  other  subjects,  a  fact  not  supported  by  our 

recordings. Second, orcas may be capable of learning new vocalizations not only at a young 

age  but  also  throughout  their  lifetime.  Thus,  their  repertoire  could  change,  as  reported  by 

previous authors (Foote et al. 2006; Hooper et al. 2006; Watwood et al. 2004).  If this were 

true,  the  present  results  could  be  interpreted  in  terms  of  vocal  convergence  and  vocal 

divergence.  This  study  opens  new  lines  of  research  regarding  the  contextual  importance  of 

diverging  versus  converging  vocally  and  the  likelihood  of  this  also  happening  in  the  wild,

wild (Ford 1991). 

given the fact that free-ranging killer whale acoustic structures seem relatively stable in the 

These  two  processes  might  be  part  of  a  necessary  adaptation  to  a  changing  social 

environment when group compositions change. It is often stressed in the literature that social 

changes,  like the one  imposed by  captive care, trigger vocal  changes  (Brown &  Farabaugh 

1997; Lemasson & Hausberger 2004; Snowdon & Elowson 1999). Unlike free-living orcas, 

captive  orcas  are  often  moved  from  one  facility  to  another;  thus,  the  group  composition  in 

which a given individual lives changes. This situation does not resemble the social stability 

of wild  orca  groups,  which is  thought  to  be one  of the major factors behind group-specific 

repertoires (e.g., Ford 1991; Ford & Fisher 1983; Yurk et al. 2002). In contrast, species living 

in less stable groups produce more individual-specific vocalizations, for instance, bottlenose 

dolphins  that  live  in  fission–fusion  societies  (e.g.,  Janik  &  Slater  1998).  According  to  this 

hypothesis, orcas that live in unstable social environments, as in captivity, might adapt their 

repertoire and produce not only group-specific but also individual-specific vocalizations. We 

know from dolphin studies that the mother has a strong impact on the acoustic structuration 

of juveniles’ repertoire (Sayigh et al. 1990). Our orcas had been separated from their parents 

at an early age, compared with what is found in the wild, where they remain in their natal pod 

even  after  independence,  and  this  might  have  also  played  a  role  here.  Why  orca  groups 

display so many different call types in their repertoire has long been a matter of vivid debate. 

Some  investigations  have  failed  to  provide  evidence  that  contextual  differences  might 

explain  the  coexistence  of  several  call  structures  in  a  given  individual  with  different 

referential  functions  (Ford  1989).  Nevertheless,  authors  agree  that  discrete  calls  primarily 

function as contact signals (Ford 1989). Here, we suggest that the functional significance of 

having several calls might be to open opportunities for a given individual to advertise vocally 

either the group to which it belongs or its social preference as well as its individual identity.

ABSTRACT 

The  Umwelt  concept  of  Jakob  von  Uexküll  considers  animals  as  subjects  that  inhabit  their  own  subjective 
universe  which  is  determined  by  the  animal’s  sensory  perception  and  cognitive  abilities.  Dolphins  present  an 
interesting  species  to  investigate  its  Umwelt  because  cetaceans  underwent  a  drastic  change  in  lifestyle  in  the 
course  of  evolution  because  these  mammals  returned  from  a  terrestrial  life  back  into  the  water.  Although 
bottlenose dolphins are intensively studied there are still many knowledge gaps. Here we studied some aspects 
of  the  dolphins’  Umwelt  by  asking:  (1)  how  their  nocturnal  acoustic  Umwelt  is  arranged;  (2)  what  the 
production of vocal copies can tell us about the dolphins’ perception of their environment; (3) whether they are 
able  to  perceive  tastes  (4)  or  odours;  (5)  whether  they  are  sensitive  to  magnetic  stimuli.  We  found  that  the 
dolphins’ nocturnal Umwelt was characterized by a temporally patterned vocal activity that also included vocal 
copies  of  sounds  that  the  dolphins  had  heard  during  the  day.  This  is  a  striking  separation  between  auditory 
memory formation and vocal copy production and the copies might be a vocally expressed nocturnal rehearsal 
of day events. Thus, vocalizations can serve as possible indicators of events or objects that are meaningful to the 
dolphins.  Regarding  dolphins’  perceptive  abilities,  we  found  that  they  were  sensitive  to  both  gustatory  and 
olfactory  food-related  stimuli.  They  might  use  this  ability  to  locate  and/or  evaluate  prey.  Further,  dolphins 
responded  to  a  magnetic  stimulus,  suggesting  that  they  are  magnetosensitive,  what  could  be  useful  for 
navigation. So far, chemo- and magnetoreception have not been considered seriously as potentially functional in 
dolphins.  The  results  obtained  during  this  thesis  fill  some  of  the  gaps  that  still  exist  in  the  knowledge  of  the 
dolphin’s  Umwelt  and  therefore  contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  this  species.  Moreover,  they  illustrate 
that even already intensively studied species may still hold important facets of their biology to  reveal and that 
research should broaden the view and remain unbiased when studying a topic. 
 

RÉSUMÉ 

Le concept d’Umwelt de Jakob von Uexküll considère les animaux comme des sujets qui habitent leur propre 
univers  subjectif  qui  est  déterminé  par  la  perception  sensorielle  de  l'animal  et  ses  capacités  cognitives.  Le 
dauphin  apparait  être  une  espèce  intéressante  pour  étudier  l’Umwelt,  car  les  cétacés  ont  subi  un  changement 
radical  de  mode  de  vie  au  cours  de  l'évolution.  Ces  mammifères  sont  passés  d’une  vie  terrestre  à  une  vie 
aquatique.  Bien  que  les  grands  dauphins  soient  intensivement  étudiés,  des  recherches  sur  leur  perception 
sensorielle  sont  encore  nécessaires.  Ici,  nous  avons  étudié  certains  aspects  de  l'Umwelt  des  dauphins  en  nous 
interrogeant  sur:  (1)  l’organisation  de  leur  Umwelt  acoustique  nocturne ;  (2)  ce  que  la  production  de  copies 
vocales par les dauphins  peut nous dire  sur  leur perception de  leur environnement  ; (3) s'ils sont capables de 
percevoir des goûts (4) ou des odeurs ; (5) s’ils  sont sensibles aux stimuli  magnétiques. Nous avons constaté 
que  l’Umwelt  nocturne  des  dauphins  a  été  caractérisé  par une  activité  vocale  avec  des  patterns  temporels  qui 
comprenaient également des copies vocales des sons que les dauphins avaient entendus au cours de la journée. 
Il s'agit d'une nette séparation entre la formation de la mémoire auditive et la production de copies vocales.  Les 
copies pourraient être des répétitions nocturnes vocalement exprimées des événements de la journée. Ainsi, les 
vocalisations peuvent servir d'indicateurs d'événements ou d'objets qui ont un sens pour les dauphins. En ce qui 
concerne les capacités perceptives des dauphins, nous avons constaté qu'ils étaient sensibles aux stimuli liés à 
l'alimentation à la fois sur les plans gustatif et olfactif. Ils peuvent utiliser cette capacité pour localiser et / ou 
évaluer  la  nature  de  leur proie. En outre, les dauphins ont  répondu à  un  stimulus  magnétique, ce  qui suggère 
qu'ils  sont  magnétosensibles,  cela  pourrait  être  utile  pour  la  navigation.  Jusqu'à  présent,  la  chimio-  et  la 
magnétoréception  n'ont  pas  été  considérées  sérieusement  comme  potentiellement  fonctionnelles  chez  les 
dauphins.  Les  résultats  obtenus  au  cours  de  cette  thèse  ont  permis  de  combler  certaines  des  lacunes  qui 
subsistaient dans la connaissance de l'Umwelt du dauphin et contribuent ainsi à une meilleure compréhension de 
cette espèce. En outre, ils montrent que des aspects importants de la biologie d’espèces pourtant intensivement 
étudiées  peuvent  être  encore  méconnus.  Cela  nous  rappelle  l’importance  de  garder  une  grande  ouverture 
d’esprit lorsque l’on étudie un sujet.
