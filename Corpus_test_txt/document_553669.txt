ABSTRACT 
Biofortified  orange-fleshed  sweet  potato  (OFSP)  is  being  promoted  to  tackle  vitamin  A 
deficiency, a serious public health problem affecting children and pregnant/lactating women 
in  sub-Saharan  Africa.    The  aim  of  the  study  was  to  quantify  and  understand  the  factors 
influencing  provitamin  A  losses  in  OFSP  dried  chips.  Losses  were  determined  after  drying 
and  storage.  A  preliminary  pilot-scale  study  demonstrated  that  carotenoid  levels  were  not 
significantly different after either solar or sun drying. Field conditions using locally-promoted 
varieties  in  Uganda  and  Mozambique  showed  losses  associated  with  drying  were  less  than 
40%.  Flour  made  from  OFSP  could  therefore  be  a  significant  source  of  provitamin  A.    In 
contrast,  storage  of  chips  at  room  temperature  in  Uganda  for  four  months  resulted  in  high 
losses of pro-vitamin A (ca. 70% loss from the initial dried product). Low-cost pretreatments, 
such  as  blanching,  antioxidants  and  salting,  did  not  improve  carotenoid  retention  during 
storage.  To  understand  the  cause  of  the  losses,  dried  sweet  potato  chips  were  stored  under 
controlled  conditions  of  temperature  (10;  20;  30;  or  40ºC),  aw  (0.1;  0.3;  0.5  or  0.7)  and 
oxygen  (0  [under  nitrogen];  2.5;  10  or  21%  [air]).  Losses  in  provitamin  A  were  the  least 
during storage at the lowest temperature and oxygen level and at the highest humidity level.  
Enzymatic  catabolism  of  β-carotene  in  the  flour  was  considered  unlikely  because  of  low 
peroxidase activities at low water activities and the loss of peroxidase activity during storage.

INTRODUCTION  
Carotenoids  are  organic  pigments  found  in  plants  that  play  an  important  role  as  vitamin  A 
precursors in the human diet. In contrast to most plant foods, 80% of the carotenoid content 
of orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) is trans-β-carotene (Bechoff et al., 2009a; Bengsston, 
et al., 2008).  Such varieties could contribute to tackling vitamin A deficiency, a main public 
health issue in the developing world (Bechoff et al., 2009a; Bengsston et al., 2008).  Sweet 
potato  is  a  very  valuable  crop  widely  consumed  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  (Woolfe  1992).  Sun 
drying of sweet potatoes is a traditional practice. Roots are either sliced or crushed and then 
dried on rocks.   These  are  stored in granaries; re-hydrated and boiled to be eaten like fresh 
roots,  or  milled  into  flour.  There  are  efforts  through  the  HarvestPlus  Challenge  Program  to 
promote the use of orange-fleshed varieties with high β-carotene content. In order to tackle

vitamin  A  deficiency  in  sub-Saharan  African  by  increased  consumption  of  OFSP,  CIP  and 
HarvestPlus Challenge Program have launched trials to incorporate OFSP in various recipes 
of African foodstuffs (Namanda et al., 2005; Owori et al., 2007). Food processing, drying and 
storage  have  been  previously  reported  to  have  a  major  effect  on  pro-vitamin  A  retention 
because  of  the  nature  of  unsaturated,  unstable  provitamin  A  carotenoids  that  are  easily 
degraded by  light,  oxygen, ultra-violet and heating leading, to significant  losses (Rodriguez 
Amaya  1997).  It  is  therefore  essential  to  optimise  Orange  Flesh  Sweet  potato  (OFSP) 
processing in order to achieve products with high nutritional quality. Few data are found on 
carotenoid  retention  from  sweet  potato  after  drying  and  storage  and  the  effect  of  direct  sun 
drying compared to solar drying.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Sweet potato varieties were obtained from partner farmers in Uganda and from Namulongue 
Agricultural Research Station of National Agricultural Research Organisation in Uganda and 
farmers  partners  with  World  Vision  International  in  Mozambique.  For  preliminary  trials  in 
France, roots were of an imported American variety (Rubina®, Agrexco). 
 
Roots were chipped using hand rotary disc chipper or sliced by hand. Dryers used were hot 
air dryer and greenhouse fan-operated solar dryer in France; tunnel and tent dryers in Uganda 
and tunnel dryer, shade in Mozambique. Open air sun dryers were used as a comparison with 
other dryers in each location. Chips were dried up to 10% moisture in average. After drying, 
chips were stored using locally bought polythene or propylene bags or traditional bags made 
of jute. 
 
Total  carotenoids  content  was  determined  on  sweet  potatoes  grown  in  Uganda  and 
Mozambique by visible spectrophotometry (UV-visible spectrophotometer) using the method 
of  Rodriguez-Amaya  and  Kimura  (2004).  For  preliminary  trials  in  France,  the  method  of 
Dhuique-Mayer  et  al.  (2005)  was  used.  Trans-β-carotene  content  was  measured  by  HPLC 
using  the  analysis  method  of  Dhuique  Mayer  et  al.  (2005)  on  preliminary  samples  (OFSP 
from USA) and samples stored in controlled conditions. Samples were extracted in duplicate 
or triplicate. Readings were made at a wavelength of 450nm.  
 
Losses  (%)  in  total  carotenoid  (or  trans-β-carotene)  content  were  calculated  following  the 
equation (1):

Where:  C:  Carotenoid  content  after  drying  (or  storage)  expressed  in  μg.g-1  dry  weight;  C0:

Carotenoid degradation followed a first order degradation during storage (Equation 2).

Where: k: constant degradation (day-1); t: storage time (days).

Where:  Ea:  activation  energy  (kJ.mol-1);  R:  gas  constant  =  8.314  J  ·  K−1.mol−1.  In  order  to 
validate the Arrhenius carotenoid degradation model in laboratory conditions, dried samples 
(Ejumula  variety)  were  stored  for  88  or  125  days  at  ambient  room  temperature  (recorded 
temperature). 
 
Statistical  analyses  on  the  analysis  of  variance  were  performed  using  SPSS  14.0  or  15.0. 
Significant  differences  per  variety  between  samples  (p<0.05)  were  given  by  Tukey  test  and 
are indicated by different letters in the same column (a, b, c).   
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Preliminary trials 
 
 Losses  in  total  carotenoid  content  and  trans-β-carotene  content  using  different  dryers  are 
reported in Table 1.

No significant difference was observed between drying by greenhouse solar dryer and direct 
sun  in  term  of  β-carotene  and  total  carotenoids.  Cross  flow  drying  (hot  air  drying) 
significantly retained a higher content of β-carotenes and total carotenoids than sun-drying. 
 
Field work in Uganda 
 
On both varieties grown in Uganda (Ejumula and Kakamega analysed jointly), no significant 
difference  was  observed  between  retention  of  carotenoids  in  tent,  tunnel  or  sun  dryers  with 
total carotenoid losses of 9.0; 9.2 and 8.7% respectively. This is contradictory to studies that 
reported  that  sun  drying  was  more  damaging  than  solar  drying  (Rodriguez  Amaya  1997, 
Mulokozi and Svanberg 2003) but agreed with levels of loss in the recent study by Bengsston 
et al. (2008) working on Ugandan OFSP.  
 
Carotenoid losses were high during storage as opposed to after drying (Table 2).

Dried  chips  stored  for  4  months  had  important  losses  for  both  varieties  (Ejumula  and 
Kakamega) with an average of 67%.  Samples of dried sweet potato stored in clear polythene 
bags  placed  under  the  window  did  not  demonstrate  any  difference  in  terms  of  loss  in 
carotenoids as compared with opaque (black bag) that was either sealed or tied with simple 
knot.  This  agreed  with  results  from  Vasquez-Caicedo  et  al.  (2007)  about  the  impact  of 
packaging and storage on pro-vitamin A retention of mango puree.  
 
Field work in Mozambique 
 
Shade drying significantly retained more total carotenoids compared to sun and solar drying 
in Mozambique with 3.3%, 10.0% and 12.2% respectively for MGCL01 and Resisto varieties 
analysed jointly. 
 
Carotenoid losses were high during storage in accordance with results in Uganda (Table 3).

Pre-treatment  did  not  reduce  carotenoid  loss.  After  four  months  of  storage,  deionised  water 
treated samples had lower total carotenoid content than untreated that had lower carotenoid 
content  than  untreated  ones.  After  six  months  of  storage,  there  was  no  difference  between 
samples. 
 
Effect of enzymes 
The effect of enzymatic activity (peroxidase) on carotenoid degradation was tested (Figure 2).

Storage study under controlled conditions 
 
The  effect  of  temperature,  water  activity  (aw)  and  oxygen  was  measured  on  Ejumula  chips 
stored under controlled conditions of temperature (10; 20; 30; or 40ºC), aw (0.1; 0.3; 0.5 or 
0.7) and oxygen (0 [under nitrogen]; 2.5; 10 or 21% [air]) (Figure 3).

For  the  total  carotenoids  and  trans  β-carotene  under  anisothermic  conditions,  the  difference

respectively.  The  robustness  of  the  model  was  further  tested  by  using  it  to  predict  the 
carotenoid content a a dried sweet potato sample (Ejumula) that had been stored in Uganda at 
ambient temperature in LPDE bags (permeable to oxygen) for 125 days in Uganda (Bechoff 
et  al.,  2009b).   Similarly,  the  model  was  also  accurate  in  it  predictions  where  for  total 
carotenoids under anisothermic conditions with a difference between the experimental value 
and model of 9.3%. Therefore it can be concluded that the model developed under samples 
stored under controlled laboratory conditions was robust enough to apply to samples stored 
under field conditions in Uganda and elsewhere. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The major conclusions from this work were: 

•  There were few carotenoid losses after drying of OFSP 
•  There were high carotenoid losses after storage of OFSP 
•  The chip size and pre-treatment failed to reduce carotenoid degradation in storage. 
•  The  enzymatic  degradation  was  unlikely  because  peroxidase  activity  was  low  or 

negligible after storage and at low water activities. 

•  Oxygen and temperature strongly influenced carotenoid degradation.  
• 

In conclusion, there was no low-cost solution to preserve provitamin A. Further work 
should focus on special packaging (eg. vacuum) and low temperature for storage
