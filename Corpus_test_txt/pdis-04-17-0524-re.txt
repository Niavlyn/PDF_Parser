Abstract

Sweepoviruses (a group of begomoviruses that infect plants in the family
Convolvulaceae) have monopartite genomes that consist of a circular,
single-stranded DNA molecule. Seventy-three complete genomic se-
quences of sweepoviruses were characterized from the sweet potato sam-
ples collected in China. Eight sweepovirus species, including two novel
species with proposed names of Sweet potato leaf curl China virus 2 and
Sweet potato leaf curl Sichuan virus 2, were identified among these sam-
ples. One species, Sweet potato leaf curl Canary virus, was first identified
in China. Among the 13 identified strains of Chinese sweepoviruses, 4 were

newly discovered. Sweet potato leaf curl virus had the highest frequency
(53.4%) of occurrence in the sweet potato samples from China. The similar-
ities among the 73 sweepovirus genomic sequences were between 77.6 and
100.0%. Multiple recombination events were identified, and 16 recombinant
sequences were determined. Recombination was observed between different
species and between different strains of the same species. Recombination
breakpoints were mainly localized on the intergenic region and in three open
reading frames (AC1, AV1, and AV2). This study is the first comprehensive
report on the genetic diversity of sweepoviruses in China.

Sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. (family Convolvulaceae),
is an important food crop in developing countries (Clark et al.
2012). Most sweet potato crops produced in eastern Asia, 80% of
which are produced in China (Anonymous 2007), the largest pro-
ducer of sweet potato in the world (Tairo et al. 2005). Sweet potato
is widely grown in China, and the following three major growing
zones for sweet potato are distinguished according to their climatic
conditions and cropping systems: the northern, Yangtze River, and
southern regions (Gao et al. 2000; Ma et al. 2012; Xie et al. 2013;
Zhang et al. 2009). Viral diseases can cause sweet potato yield losses
and cultivar decline and are a major constraint in sweet potato pro-
duction (Clark et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2010). In the United States,
the yields from sweet potato cuttings infected with Sweet potato leaf
curl virus (SPLCV) are reduced by 11 to 86%, depending on the cul-
tivar tested (Gibson and Kreuze 2015). Sweet potato plants are in-
fected by over 30 viruses, including RNA and DNA viruses (Clark
et al. 2012). Among these viruses, 11 were identified as begomoviruses
(Adams et al. 2016; Zerbini et al. 2017).

Begomovirus is the largest genus in the family Geminiviridae
and consists of >320 recognized species (Zerbini et al. 2017). Phylo-
genetic analysis showed that the begomoviruses further display a
clear subdivision into four groups: Old World, New World, and the
so-called “sweepoviruses” and “legumoviruses” (Zerbini et al. 2017).
Sweepoviruses form a group (phylogenetically distinct from Old
World and New World begomoviruses) that infects plants of the family
Convolvulaceae, including sweet potato (Hassan et al. 2016). Genomes
of sweepoviruses consist of approximately 2,800 nucleotides (nt) and
encode two open reading frames (ORF) (AV1 and AV2) in the viral-
sense strand and four ORF (AC1 to AC4) in the complementary-sense
strand (Lozano et al. 2009). Five species of sweepoviruses—namely,

SPLCV, Sweet potato leaf curl China virus (SPLCCNV), Sweet potato
leaf curl Georgia virus (SPLCGV), Sweet potato leaf curl Sichuan
virus 1 (SPLCSiV-1), and Sweet potato leaf curl Henan virus
(SPLCHnV)—were discovered in eight provinces of China (Bi and
Zhang 2012; Chung et al. 1985; Liu et al. 2013, 2014; Luan et al.
2006; Qin et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2013).

The high genomic diversity of sweepoviruses was reported previ-
ously in some countries. For instance, Lozano et al. (2009) found five
species of sweepoviruses in Spain and reported multiple recombi-
nation events that shaped the populations of Ipomoea-infecting
begomoviruses. Ten genotypes of sweepoviruses exhibiting high ge-
netic diversity (Zhang and Ling 2011) were reported in the United
States (Mississippi and South Carolina). High diversity of sweet
potato-associated geminiviruses (including two new species, three
strains, and many variants of sweepoviruses) was found in 55 sam-
ples collected from a Brazilian germplasm bank (Paprotka et al.
2010). In 2012, three species, three novel strains, and 13 variants
of sweepoviruses were reported in Brazil; thus, the genetic diversity
was considerably greater than in the previous finding (Albuquerque
et al. 2012).

In China, the diversity of sweepoviruses is not extensively inves-
tigated. Consequently, no foundation is available for disease control
and prevention. Therefore, we studied the genetic diversity among
sweepoviruses in sweet potato samples collected from 2010 to
2015 in China. We determined 73 complete genomic sequences us-
ing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rolling-circle amplification
(RCA) methods. Variations of nucleic acid sequences, recombination
events, and evolutionary relationships of the sweepoviruses in China
were also investigated.

Materials and Methods

Collection of samples. From 2010 to 2015, >1,000 sweet potato
cuttings with virus-like symptoms were collected from 22 provinces
in three major sweet-potato-growing regions in China (Fig. 1). Leaf
samples were collected and stored at –80°C until analysis.

Nucleic acid extraction. DNA was extracted from the leaf tissues
of sweet potato using the universal genomic DNA extraction kit
(TaKaRa) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted DNA
was frozen at –80°C until analysis.

Cloning and sequencing of the complete genome of sweepoviruses.
PCR assays were conducted using three sets of begomovirus-universal
primers: namely, BM-V/BM-C (Briddon and Markham 1994),

PCRc1/PBL1v (Rojas et al. 1993), and Beta0l/Beta02 (Gibson and
Kreuze 2015) (Supplementary Table S1). The amplified PCR products
were ligated to pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa). The ligated product was
transformed into an Escherichia coli competent cell (JM109), and the
positive clones were sent to TaKaRa and Sangon Biotech for sequencing.
The DNA extracted from samples Guangxi5:2011 and Henan4:
2012 was amplified using the universal primers BM-V and BM-C, re-
spectively. According to the determined sequence, two pairs of primers
(GUI-11-5-1/GUI-11-5-2 and Henan-12-4-1/Henan-12-4-2) were de-
signed to amplify the remaining part of the geminivirus genome. Com-
plete sequences were obtained by splicing the two-part sequences.

RCA was implemented as described by Haible et al. (2006). Cir-
cular genomic DNA was amplified using an Illustra TempliPhi 100
Amplification kit (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s in-
structions. The amplified product (1 ml) was digested in a 15-ml vol-
ume container with the restriction enzyme BamHI. The digested
products were separated in a 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA fragments
of the expected size (2.8 kb) were purified using an AxyPrep DNA
Gel Extraction Kit (AXYGEN). The purified products were ligated
into pUC118 vector (TaKaRa) digested with the corresponding re-
striction enzyme. The ligated product was transformed into E. coli
competent cell and the positive clones were sequenced at TaKaRa
and Sangon Biotech.

Sequence analysis. Nucleotide similarity searches of the National
Center for Biotechnology Information database (https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/) were conducted using the Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST). The nucleotide identity percentages of the
complete genome were compared with those of the closely related
begomoviruses using the Sequence Demarcation Tool (SDT) pro-
gram (http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~brejnev/) (Muhire et al. 2013). As rec-
ommended by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) Geminiviridae Study Group, viruses with nucleotide identity
of <91% between full genome sequences were considered to be dis-
tinct species. If the sequence shared <94% genome-wide pairwise
identity with all isolates described for that species, then the isolates
were considered to be distinct strains (Brown et al. 2015).

In addition to the full genomic sequences obtained in this study, 11
sequences representing sweepovirus species (Supplementary Table
S2) and 33 relevant sequences (Supplementary Table S3) were avail-
able in public sequence databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
and were aligned using the SDT software (Muhire et al. 2013). Phy-
logenetic relationships were inferred with 1,000 bootstrap replicates,
and evolutionary distances were calculated using the P distance
method implemented in the MEGA7 software (Sudhir et al. 2016).
Recombination analysis. In total, 117 sweepovirus sequences, in-
cluding the 73 sequences obtained in this study, were selected and

aligned using Muscle with default settings (Edgar 2004). Recombi-
nation events were screened using RDP, GENECOV, Bootscan,
MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3Seq methods implemented in the
RDP4.77 program (Martin et al. 2010, 2015). We considered only
the potential recombination events that were detected using the seven
methods described above and involved fragments sharing $97%
sequence identity with their parental sequences (Albuquerque et al.
2012).

Results

Species and molecular characteristics of sweepoviruses in China.
Seventy-three complete sequences of sweepovirus were determined.
The relevant information and accession numbers for the 73 sequences
collected from different provinces in China are shown in Table 1.
Using the ICTV guidelines of taxonomic criteria for the genus
Begomovirus (Geminiviridae) and the SDT software with a species
classification limit (91% nt sequence identity) for begomoviruses
(Brown et al. 2015), 61 of 73 isolates were classified as isolates of six
known species (Table 1): namely, SPLCV, SPLCCNV, SPLCGV,
Sweet potato leaf curl Canary virus (SPLCCV), SPLCSiV-1, and
SPLCHnV. The remaining 12 isolates had less than 91% sequence sim-
ilarity with other known begomoviruses and belonged to new species
(Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Among these 12 sweepovirus
isolates, 10 isolates (KF156759, KJ476509, KJ013573, KJ013574,
KX033427, KX033437, KU992910, KX033422, KX033424, and
KX073967) had 90.0 to 99.7% sequence similarity. KU992910 had
90% sequence similarity with KX073967 but had 99.1% sequence
similarity with KJ013574. Thus, these 10 isolates belonged to the
same novel species with the proposed name Sweet potato leaf curl
Sichuan virus 2 (SPLCSiV-2). This species was approved by ICTV
(Adams et al. 2016). Two isolates (KJ476510 and KJ476508) had
96.4% nucleotide sequence similarity and thus belonged to the same
novel species with the proposed name Sweet potato leaf curl China
virus 2 (SPLCCNV-2).

Among these eight species found in China, SPLCCV was first dis-
covered in sweet potato in China. Two species (SPLCCNV-2 and
SPLCSiV-2) were novel sweepovirus species, and SPLCSiV-2 was
approved and ratified by ICTV (Adams et al. 2016).

The 73 sweepovirus isolates from China possess similar gespecies.
The sweepovirus genome comprised approximately 2,800 nt, from
which two ORFs (AV1 and AV2) in the viral-sense strand and four
ORFs (AC1–AC4) in the complementary-sense strand were predicted.
Based on distribution and frequency analyses, sweepoviruses were
widely distributed in China and were detected in 11 provinces
(Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 1). Seven sweepovirus species were found in
Henan Province, whereas four and three sweepovirus species were

detected in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, respectively. A sin-
gle species was identified in Shandong, Anhui, Hainan, Jilin, and
Hubei provinces. The species SPLCV had the highest frequency
(53.4%, Table 2) and was detected in 10 provinces, followed by
SPLCSiV-2 (13.7%) and SPLCGV (12.3%). SPLCHnV had the least
frequency (1.4%) and was only detected in Henan Province.

Molecular variation and genetic diversity of sweepoviruses
in China. BLAST analysis showed that these sweepovirus sequences
were closely related to Old World begomoviruses. The similarities
between the 73 sweepovirus genomic sequences were between 77.6
and 100.0% (Supplementary Table S4). The 73 isolates were classified
into 13 strains according to the strain demarcation criteria for begomo-
viruses proposed by Brown et al. (2015). The species SPLCV consists
of four strains, including a new one named “SPLCV-Hn” (Table 1, Sup-
plementary Table S6). The species SPLCGV comprised two strains
(Table 1, Supplementary Table S7). The 10 isolates of the new species
SPLCSiV-2 are composed of two strains with the proposed names
“SPLCSiV-2-Sc” and “SPLCSiV-2-JS” (Table 1, Supplementary Table
S8). The three isolates of SPLCCV species from China had 99.8 to
99.9% sequence similarities and less than 94% similarity with the known
isolates of SPLCCV. Thus, these isolates constitute a new strain named
“SPLCCV-CN” (Supplementary Table S9). SPLCCNV, SPLCSiV-1,
and SPLCHnV all have one strain based on the 94% cut-off (Supple-
mentary Table S10, S11, and S12). The phylogenetic relationships
among the 73 sweepovirus isolates and other represented sweepovirus
species are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the patterns of phylogenetic clus-
tering depicted in the figure, the sweepoviruses in China were grouped
into eight clades, namely, SPLCV, SPLCGV, SPLCCV, SPLCSiV-2,
SPLCCNV, SPLCCNV-2, SPLCHnV, and SPLCSiV-1.

Recombination analysis of sweepoviruses in China. We ana-
lyzed the recombination in a 117-sequence alignment, which in-
cludes the 73 full-length sweepoviruses described in this work, 11
sequences representing sweepovirus species, and 33 other relevant
sequences. Frequent recombination events were detected in these
sweepoviruses. Based on this analysis (using the seven statistical meth-
ods implemented in RDP software with high probability), the 117 isolates
collectively bear 38 detectable recombination events, indicating that the
recombinants were widespread across the 117 sequences (Supplementary
Table S13). In considering only those potential recombination events that
were detected using seven of the methods and have fragments that shared
$97% sequence identity with their parental sequences, we determined
16 recombinant sequences belonging to six species (Table 3) in the final
analysis. The SPLCV species had more recombinant isolates than other
species. Recombination occurred between different species (interspecific
recombination, such as between SPLCSiV-2 and SPLCV) or between
different strains of the same species (intraspecific recombination, such
as between SPLCV-Fu and SPLCV-Sh, SPLCV-Fu and SPLCV-US,
and SPLCV-Sh and SPLCV-JP). In general, recombination break-
points were mainly localized in the intergenic region (IR) and AC1,
AV1, and AV2 ORF. Most of the recombination breakpoints were lo-
calized in the complementary sense genes. Specifically, SPLCSiV-2-Js
(KX073967) was identified as a recombinant (between nucleotides
274 and 1,850) of SPLCSiV-2-Sc (KJ013573, 99.7%) and SPLCV-
Sh (KJ013580, 99.6%) (range P = 1.243 × 10−74 to 1.440 × 10−11)
(Table 3). SPLCCNV-2 (KJ476508) contains sequences derived

Discussion

The species and distribution of sweepoviruses in China were iden-
tified and analyzed in this study. The sweepoviruses in China can
be divided into eight species, among which two new species
(SPLCCNV-2 and SPLCSiV-2) were identified. SPLCSiV-2 was ap-
proved and ratified by ICTV in April 2016 and was listed on the
ICTV website (Adams et al. 2016). The SPLCCV species was first
discovered in China. Among the 13 identified strains, 4 were newly
found. SPLCV was a dominant species detected in 10 provinces.
The phylogenetic tree showed that the 73 sweepoviruses collected
from different parts of China were grouped into eight clades. The
sweepoviruses in China had rich genetic inter- and intraspecific var-
iations. To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive re-
port on sweepoviruses in China.

Previous studies showed the high genetic diversity and recombina-
tion of sweepoviruses (Albuquerque et al. 2011, 2012; Lozano et al.
2009; Paprotka et al. 2010; Zhang and Ling 2011), which were sim-
ilar to the results obtained in China. A high diversity indicates a high
risk of evolution for many severe strains or species through recombi-
nation. Most recombination breakpoints were found during recombi-
nation events, which were mainly in the origin of replication (Zhang
and Ling 2011) between AC2 and AC4 (Zhang and Ling 2011), in
conjunction with predicted hairpin structures (Paprotka et al. 2010)
or the IR, and in the middle of the AC1 ORF (Albuquerque et al.
2012). Our recombination analyses showed that the breakpoints of re-
combination mainly occurred in the IR and AC1, AV1, and AV2
ORF of sweepoviruses in China, which differed from those of sweepo-
viruses in the United States (IR and between AC2 and AC4) (Zhang and
Ling 2011). The occurrence of natural recombination events may con-
tribute to the appearance of many new sweepoviruses (Albuquerque
et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2013, 2014; Zhang and Ling 2011). These phe-
nomena suggested that virus monitoring should be strengthened to
prevent and control the evolution of sweepoviruses.

Leaf curl, mosaic, and yellow leaves are the common symptoms
for sweet potato infection by sweepoviruses (Albuquerque et al.
2012; Liu et al. 2013, 2014; Lozano et al. 2009; Luan et al. 2006;
Paprotka et al. 2010; Qin et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2013; Zhang and

2102 Plant Disease / Vol. 101 No. 12

Ling 2011). In our research, the symptoms of sweepovirus-positive
samples included leaf curl, mosaic, fan-shaped leaves, vein yellow-
ing, chlorotic spots, leaf shriveling, leaf malformation, and stunting
(Table 1). Approximately 60% of the sweepovirus-positive samples
presented leaf curl, thus making this symptom an important diagnos-
tic marker for sweet potato infection by sweepoviruses.

b-Satellite (previously known as DNA-b) is a circular, single-
stranded DNA of approximately 1,350 nt that is associated with
many monopartite begomoviruses and is essential for the induction
of typical disease symptoms (Zhou 2013). b-Satellites depend on
their helper viruses for replication, for cell-to-cell and systemic
spread throughout the host, for encapsidation, and for transmission
to new host plants via insect vectors (Zhou 2013). Swapna Geetanjali
et al. found evidence of a natural association of two different
b-satellites (CroYVMB and PaLCuB) with SPLCV in I. purpurea.
The two different b-satellites were associated with leaf curl and yellow
vein symptoms on the host plants (Swapna Geetanjali et al. 2013).
Neither DNA-B nor b-satellite was detected from 530 DNA samples
collected in China using specific primers for DNA-B or DNA-b of bego-
moviruses. The sweepoviruses detected in the present study are
monopartites and do not contain satellite molecules.

Understanding the diversity of viruses is important for preventing
and controlling viral diseases. We extensively collected sweet potato
samples in China and analyzed the species, distribution, and variation
of sweepoviruses in these samples. A detailed knowledge of the diversity
of viruses in sweet potato will help in devising future control measures.
