I would like to begin and end my acknowledgments with a quote. I believe measuring 

Winston Churchill 

animal  welfare  an  inherently  difficult  task,  but,  as  a  self-proclaimed  optimist,  I  have 

been inspired over the last years to see what opportunities lie in this field in terms of 

better  understanding  dolphins.  To  this  end,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  people  and 

animals who have supported me along the way.  

 
My greatest and foremost thanks go to my supervisors Fabienne Delfour and Heiko 

Rödel, without whom this thesis simply would not have been initiated nor completed 

with  the  same  success.  Fabienne,  thank  you  for  imparting  some  of  your  vast 

knowledge  on  cetaceans  to  me,  for  teaching  me  how  to  conduct  ethological 

experiments  that  seamlessly  integrate  with  the  dolphins’  lives,  and  most  of  all,  for 

inspiring and motivating me to continue working in this field. You have also been an 

incredible mentor to me and have provided invaluable support in all areas of my life 

over the last three years: I am very much looking forward to continuing our friendship 

in  the  years  to  come.  Heiko,  thank  you  for  being  such  an  excellent  and  diligent 

teacher in all things related to conducting and reporting scientific experiments. Your 

input to the projects was extremely insightful, and I really appreciated your sense of 

fun  and  ability  to  keep  things  in  perspective-  at  times  I  couldn’t  have  carried  on 

without  it.  Your  incredible  work  ethic  is  completely  inspiring  and  I  can  only  hope  to 

reach a comparable level one day. You were also a brilliant mentor to me and your 

advice was and will always be greatly valued. 

I  would  also  like  to  sincerely  thank  Birgitta  Mercera  and  Parc  Astérix  itself  for 

facilitating  the  entire  project  and  supporting  it  throughout  its  fruition.  You  always 

aimed to accommodate my goals and provided invaluable input for the experiments. I 

think your dedication and encouragement of scientific investigation into the animals’ 

welfare is exceptional, and I will be forever grateful for your belief in the project.  

Equally, the insight and suggestions from the team of trainers at Parc Astérix helped 

my project immensely. I learnt so much from their anecdotes and observations, and 

during  the  experiments  they  were  always  willing  to  participate  and  help  out.

Stéphane, Caro, Deb, Fleur, Julien, Daphné, Juana, Sully and Ludivine: merci mille 

fois pour toute votre aide et support, et vous me manquerez tout énormément!   

Welfare studies need many subjects and multidimensional expertise, and this project 

benefitted  hugely  from  collaborations  with  other  dolphin  facilities.  A  huge  thank  you 

to  the  teams  at  Planète  Sauvage,  Dolfinarium  Harderwijk,  Boudewijn  Seapark  and 

Attica Park: your willingness to participate in the research meant a great deal to me. 

Niels, your expertise throughout the process was especially invaluable, thank you. 

To  my  friends:  I  have  realised  that  similar  to  the  dolphins,  strong  social  bonds  and 

support  seem  to  be  of  particular  importance  in  my  life,  so  thank  you  for  celebrating 

the  good  times  and  carrying  me  through  the  difficult  periods.  Whether  in  Paris, 

London, the US or elsewhere, you know who you are and I am so grateful for you. 

My family have been and always will be my rock and were my first port of call during 

the highs and the lows of the last three years- Mum, Dad, Eloisa, Hugh and Tom, you 

have  helped  me  so  much  and  sorry  for  all  the  rants/excess  of  dolphin  pictures  on 

WhatsApp! More profoundly, my family’s influence on my personality and capabilities 

are  the  real  reason  I  was  able  to  complete  thesis:  my  Mum  taught  me  true 

compassion, my most valued quality above all else; my Dad gave me an indomitable 

work  ethic  and  my  optimism;  to  my  Grandfather,  I  learnt  from  you  how  to  be 

passionate and spirited about work and life; and to my Grandmother, you instilled in 
me a deep love and interest for animals.  

Lastly, and linked to the final quote, I would like to say thank you to the animals. My 

first  dog  Tilly  showed  me  just  how  strong  a  human-animal  bond  can  be,  and  the 

dolphins I have studied continue to amaze and fascinate me, as much now as when I 

first laid eyes on them. To the Parc Astérix dolphins (especially Femke, Ekinox and 

Baily-  sorry  for  having  favourites!),  thank  you  for  providing  such  meaningful 

interactions over the years. True to form, I have found the more I study dolphins the 
more I realise I don’t know, but luckily I see this as a lifetime of more opportunities! 

“...To the Dolphin alone, beyond all other, nature has granted what the best 

philosophers seek: friendship for no advantage”

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction	

The study of animal welfare is now an established discipline and has tasked 

itself with measuring how an animal is feeling in its environment (Boissy et al., 2007; 

Désiré  et  al.,  2002;  Mendl  and  Paul,  2004;  Yeates  and  Main,  2008).  This  has  been 

achieved  through  measuring  aspects  of  health,  behaviour,  physiology  and  cognitive 

processing  in  order  to  arrive  at  an  accurate  estimation  of  the  animal’s  internal 

subjective  state  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007;  Webster,  2005).  Animal  welfare  science  was 

born out of concerns regarding conditions for farm animals as described in the 1960s 

Brambell  report  (Veissier  et  al.,  2008),  and  although  the  research  effort  remains 

focussed  on  this  industry,  welfare  studies  are  increasingly  being  conducted  on 

laboratory,  companion,  and  recently  zoo-housed  animals  (Webster,  2005;  Whitham 

and  Wielebnowski,  2013).  Dolphins  (family  Delphinidae)  are  among  those  animals 

often  maintained  for  public  display,  i.e.  in  zoological  parks  and  aquaria  (hereafter 

zoos),  and  of  them  the  most  common  species  kept  is  the  bottlenose  dolphin 

(Tursiops  truncatus)  (Wells  and  Scott,  1999).  Bottlenose  dolphins  are  gregarious 

mammals  with  purported  advanced  cognitive  abilities,  and  are  relatively  adaptable 

towards life in a captive environment (Mason, 2010; Schusterman et al., 2013; Wells 

and Scott, 1999). Their existence in zoos worldwide has captured the interest of the 

public,  media,  politicians,  and  scientists  alike,  but  unfortunately  there  is  increasing 

discordance among the many stakeholders about this species’ and other delphinids’ 

level of welfare (Brando et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2007; Marino et al., 2007), perhaps 

due to the industry’s past links with circus-style attractions (Maple and Perdue, 2013) 

and/or  how  the  general  public  perceives  these  animals  (Servais,  2005).  However, 

this collective concern over dolphin welfare has not yet translated into scientific effort: 

very little research exists on this topic (Clegg et al., 2015).  

 

The  motivation  behind  this  thesis  was  to  contribute  to  emerging  field  of 

dolphin welfare research, through providing the first building blocks of knowledge and 

stimulating future studies in the multidisciplinary topics involved. Bottlenose dolphins 

are  the  most  common  delphinids  found  in  zoo  collections  (Wells  and  Scott,  1999) 

and the most often studied in scientific terms (Hill and Lackups, 2010), and thus are 

used as the model species in this first in-depth exploration of cetacean welfare. While 

bottlenose dolphins were the only species used in the practical experiments, the lack 

of  welfare  studies  on  this  species  meant  that  findings  from  other  delphinids  were 

sometimes used to support reviews, theoretical discussions and study design when 

research  was  not  available  for  bottlenose  dolphins  (it  is  specified  when  concepts 

	

 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						9	

	
apply  only  to  T.  truncatus).  The  focus  during  the  thesis  remained  on  animal-based 

measures  (those  assessing  aspects  of  the  animal  itself  e.g.  behaviour)  of  positive 

and  negative  affective  states,  where  at  first,  theoretical  and  practical  investigations 

were  needed 

to 

identify  potential  measures  of  bottlenose  dolphin  welfare. 

Subsequently, the potential indicators were tested within well-established welfare test 

paradigms  validated  in  other  species.  The  indicators  with  the  most  potential  for 

welfare  measurement  were  then  investigated  further,  principally  in  terms  of  their 

inter-individual variation and what they might tell us about how the animals perceive 

their  environment.  Lastly,  the  applications  of  welfare  tools  in  dolphin  institutions are 

explored,  with  an  international  multi-facility  project  launched  to  establish  whether 

behavioural  scoring  by  animal  trainers  could  predict  welfare  changes.  Hereto,  this 

introduction  describes  current  animal-based  approaches  to  measuring  animal 

welfare,  existing  dolphin  welfare  research,  as  well  how  indicators  of  affective  state 

might be used to understand the animals’ perception of their environment.  

Methods of assessing animal welfare 

 

Defining welfare 

Since  the  genesis  of  animal  welfare  research  (see  Paper  1  for  full  review) 

there  has  been  much  debate  over  how  to  define  an  animal’s  welfare  state,  and  in 

general proponents tended to support one of three types of definition: welfare based 

on  health  status,  welfare  based  on  whether  the  animal  was  living  a  “natural  life”,  or 

welfare  based  on  what  the  animal  was  feeling  (Fraser  et  al.,  1997).  Although  some 

discussions  are  still  on-going,  researchers  have  generally  settled  on  the  latter 

“feelings-based”  definitions  (reviews  by  Broom  and  Fraser,  2015;  Dawkins,  2015), 

which follow the premise that welfare is solely determined by the animal’s subjective 

feelings  and  emotions.  This  is  concurrent  to  general  movement  away  from  how  an 

animal  is  ‘coping’  in  its  environment  (Broom,  1991)  to  how  it  might  thrive  and 

experience  positive  states  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007;  Yeates  and  Main,  2008).  A  typical 

“feelings-based  definition”  was  followed  throughout  this  thesis,  chosen  for  its  equal 

consideration  of  positive  and  negative  states  and  its  concurrence  with  theories  of 

measuring  complex  emotions  and  affective  states  in  animals  (such  as  Mendl  et  al., 

2010). This definition describes welfare as the “…balance between positive (reward, 

satisfaction) and negative (stress) experiences or affective states. The balance may 

range  from  positive  (good  welfare)  to  negative  (poor  welfare)”  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001). 

Affective  states  are  thought  of  as  emotions  grouped  together,  and  they  themselves 

combine  over  time  to  constitute  overall  welfare  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007;  Mendl  et  al., 

 

 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						10	

	
2010;  Panksepp,  2005).  Welfare  could  then  imaginably  be  investigated  and 

measured for any animal, including those in the wild (Papastavrou et al., 2017), but 

of course the vast majority of past work has focussed on those in captivity since they 

are  under  our  more  direct  responsibility  (Butterworth,  2017).  A  few  studies 

differentiate  between  animal  well-being  and  welfare,  with  some  researchers 

preferring  to  use  ‘animal  well-being’  due  to  the  fact  that  the  term  ‘animal  welfare’ 

became attached to animal rights activism, especially in the US (Clark et al., 1997). 

However  the  majority  use  the  terms  interchangeably  (Maple  and  Perdue,  2013; 

Mason  and  Veasey,  2010)  and  ‘animal  welfare’  remains  the  central  concept  in 

considering the quality of life of animals (Appleby and Sandøe, 2002). 

Animal vs. resource-based measures 

There  are  two  types  of  welfare  measures  generally  used  in  assessments: 

firstly, animal-based measures are those that assess aspects of the animal itself, i.e. 

its  behaviour,  disease  status,  or  body  condition.  In  contrast,  resource-based 

measures aim to evaluate welfare by assessing the resources provided to the animal 

(e.g.  pool  size)  (Whay  et  al.,  2003).  Whereas  resource-based  measures  were 

exclusively  used  in  past  welfare  discussions,  it  is  now  agreed  that  animal-based 

measures are more accurate reflections of welfare, mainly since they are able to take 

into account an individual’s responses to the environment and indicate the resulting 

emotional  states,  where  resource-based  measures  cannot  (Roe  et  al.,  2011). 

However, it is often more difficult to develop animal-based measures and find ways 

to standardise and apply them in situ (Roe et al., 2011; Rushen et al., 2011; Whitham 

and  Wielebnowski,  2009).  Nevertheless, 

the  preference  of  animal-based 

assessments  is  considered  an  achievable  task  and  significant  advance  in  the  field, 

along  with  the  recognition  that  welfare  policy  should  not  only  prevent  suffering  but 

also promote positive emotions and affective states (Boissy et al., 2007; Yeates and 

Main,  2008).  Welfare  assessments  aiming  to  determine  an  animal’s  welfare  state 

should be comprehensive in nature i.e. they should capture the overall, holistic state 

through a large group of measures, as opposed to just selected elements (Dawkins, 

2006;  Pritchard  et  al.,  2005).  Comprehensive  welfare  assessments  based  on  these 

principles  have  been  developed  for  farm  animals  and  have  started  to  influence 

industry  regulations,  such  as 

those 

from 

the  WelfareQuality®  project  (e.g. 

WelfareQuality®,  2009a,b,c).  Some  frameworks  have  been  updated  to  stay  in  line 

with the latest thinking, for example the Five Domains model which makes inferences 

about  negative  and  now  also  positive  affective  states  (Domain  5)  by  using  a 

combination  of  animal-  and  resource-based  measures  (Domains  1-4)  (Mellor  and 

	

 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						11	

	
Beausoleil,  2015).  Given  the  dearth  of  dolphin  welfare  research,  we  might  assume 

that  the  approaches  described  above  are  not  feasible  or  are  inapplicable  to  marine 

mammals.  However  this  is  not  the  case:  many  welfare  assessments  are  based  on 

general paradigms which are not species-specific (e.g. the ‘Five Freedoms’, FAWC, 

1992,  and  the  Five  Domains  model,  Mellor  and  Beausoleil,  2015).  Consequently, 

assessment  frameworks  are  often  described  as  highly  adaptable  to  other  species 

than those for which they were originally designed (Botreau et al., 2012; Veissier and 

Miele, 2015). In recent years such adaptions have taken place, such as with the well-

received  WelfareQuality®  assessment  and  its  application  to  fur-farm  animals 

(Mononen et al., 2012), dogs (Canis familiaris) in shelters (Barnard and Ferri, 2015), 

horses (Equus caballus) (Dalla Costa et al., 2014), and in the years since this thesis 

started,  to  bottlenose  dolphins  (Clegg  et  al.,  2015).  While  it  is  ideal  to  conduct  a 

welfare  assessment  on  an  individual  animal  if  the  goal  is  to  improve  its  welfare 

(Barber, 2009), this is not always feasible for species living in large groups on farms 

and may also be the case in some zoo settings. Nevertheless, steps can be taken to 

assess welfare at the group-level where valuable data can be gathered on a sample 

of  animals  and  results  extrapolated  to  the  rest  of  the  group  (as  in  WelfareQuality® 

2009 a,b,c), and with some modifications animal-based measures can be performed 

at the group-level as well (Johnsen et al., 2001). 

 

Strong support has been given for adapting farm animal welfare principles to 

zoo  settings  (Barber,  2009;  Hill  and  Broom,  2009;  Whitham  and  Wielebnowski, 

2013),  where  long-term,  focal  animal  studies  would  be  feasible  and  very  useful  for 

the  field  (Maple,  2007),  and  thus  all  that  remains  is  for  the  approach  to  be  fully 

embraced  by  scientists  and  the  industry’s  stakeholders.  Zoo  welfare  studies  are 

increasingly  being  conducted  and  are  becoming  a  central  research  activity  in  many 

organisations  (Baird  et  al.,  2016;  Maple  and  Perdue,  2013).  Initial  work  has 

investigated indicators of welfare such as stress hormones (e.g. Menargues Marcilla 

et al., 2012; Pifarré et al., 2012), response to environmental enrichment (Carlstead et 

al.,  1993;  Meehan  and  Mench,  2007)  or  presence  of  stereotypic  behaviour 

(Montaudouin  and  Le  Pape,  2005;  Shepherdson  et  al.,  2013).  The  power  of 

conclusion  from  zoo  research  is  often  hampered  by  small  sample  sizes  and 

difficulties  in  standardisation,  and  as  a  result  multi-institutional  studies  have  proved 

very  valuable  (Baird  et  al.,  2016)  and  should  be  greatly  encouraged  in  future 

endeavours  (Maple  and  Perdue,  2013).  There  is  also  an  emerging  focus  involving 

zoo  research  where  organisations  representing  different  stakeholders  are  realising 

that  objective,  animal-based  welfare  measures  developed  in  captive  studies can  be  

used in conservation and management projects in the wild (Maple and Perdue, 2013; 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						12	

	
Ohl and van der Staay, 2012). Several experts have recently voiced their support for 

the  application  of  welfare  assessment  frameworks  specifically  to  marine  mammal 

conservation (Papastavrou et al., 2017; Seuront and Cribb, 2017).   

 

 

Measuring emotional states  

When  validating  the  animal-based  measures  used  in  assessments,  i.e. 

verifying  that  certain  indicators  are  indeed  reflective  of  emotions  or  larger  affective 

states/welfare,  correlating  at  least  behavioural  and  physiological  data  is  superior  to 

single  or  one-dimensional  parameters  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007;  Désiré  et  al.,  2002; 

Mason  and  Veasey,  2010).  If  possible,  cognitive  parameters  should  also  be 

measured  to  increase  accuracy  further:  changes  in  emotion  (and  thus  affective 

states) are typically accompanied by neural, behavioural, physiological and cognitive 

adjustments (Mendl et al., 2010; Paul et al., 2005) and therefore the associated fields 

of study are the ones most often implicated in welfare research. Emotions have two 

dimensions,  arousal  and  valence,  and  while  the  level  of  arousal  is  often  easily 

measured  through  behavioural  and  physiological  measures,  valence  is  hard  to 

discern  without  cognitive  parameters  (Paul  et  al.,  2005).  Webster  (2005)  explained 

this concept elegantly using the principle of ‘Triangulation’, where he labels the three 

categories  of  welfare  measures  as  points  of  a  triangle:  behaviour,  physiology  and 

neurobiology. The true centre is the animal’s actual welfare and the predicted welfare 

state starts on one of the points with a certain category, and adding second and third 

bearings (categories) brings the predicted welfare ever closer to the centre. In order 

to develop welfare measures for any species for which there is little explicit research, 

potential  indicators  of  emotions,  structured  into  these  broad  categories,  should  first 

be identified (Mendl et al., 2010; Veissier et al., 2012). 

 

The  two  main  approaches  to  studying  emotions  are  labelled  as  the  discrete 

emotion  or  dimensional  emotion  theories  where  in  the  former,  emotions  are 

measured  using  the  already-established  emotions  categorised  in  human  language 

(Scherer, 2005). This approach on its own is not overly conducive to animal models, 

since it is not yet clear whether and to what extent they experience the same types of 

emotions  as  humans,  and  (thus  far)  verbal  reports  are  not  possible  (Mendl  et  al., 

2010).  Dimensional  theories  from  human  psychology  propose  that  emotions  are  all 

found  within  quadrants  bisected  by  two  axes:  arousal  and  valence  (Burgdorf  and 

Panksepp,  2006;  Russell  and  Barrett,  1999).  Therefore  measuring  the  degree  of 

arousal  (higher  or  lower  energy)  and  valence  (pleasant  or  not  pleasant)  can 

differentiate  the  many  different  types  of  emotions  felt,  and  thus  their  related 

behaviours and physiological indicators can also be considered in terms of these two

dimensions.  Although  always  kept  separate  in  the  past,  several  social  science 

scholars  combined  the  two  approaches  and  found  they  complimented  each  other 

well:  the  discrete  emotions  were  overlaid  onto  the  arousal  and  valence  dimensions 

(Burgdorf and Panksepp, 2006; Russell and Barrett, 1999; Scherer, 2005). Recently, 

for  the  first  time,  this  combined  framework  (Fig.  1)  was  proposed  for  the  study  of 

animal  emotions  (Mendl  et  al.,  2010),  and  is  likely  to  be  very  useful  in  encouraging 

“bigger  picture”  discussions  on  the  affective  states  of  non-human  animals,  allowing 

moods and complex emotions are able to be logically investigated (Panksepp, 2011).

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						14	

Following  on  from  this  model  (Fig.  1),  Mendl  and  co-authors  (2010)  also 

proposed how overall core affective state might change with time, which they explain 

by differentiating between the “emotion-eliciting situations” and “free-floating moods” 

(i.e.  longer-term,  and  not  directed  at  particular  objects  or  events)  which  make  up 

such  states.  Despite  time  being  an  important  factor  in  measuring  core  affect,  it  is 

likely  that  longer-term  core  affect  can  still  be  inferred  from  shorter-term  measures. 

Since moods are thought to be culminations of shorter-term emotional responses to 

situations, an individual’s core affective state, which we take to be synonymous with 

overall welfare state, will always be closely linked to the rewards and threats present 

in  the  animal’s  environment  (Mendl  et  al.,  2010).  If  we  want  to  measure  this 

somehow  in  a  welfare  assessment  i.e.  capture  all  the  different  aspects  of  an 

individual’s response to its environment, many and varied parameters must be used 

to allow such evaluations to be as holistic and comprehensive as possible (Dawkins, 

2006;  Pritchard  et  al.,  2005).  This  is  echoed  in  the  other  principal  concept  followed 

throughout  this  thesis:  the  ‘Triangulation’  of  different  welfare  measures  (Webster, 

2005).  In  order  to  visualise  the  concepts  studied  in  this  thesis,  I  combined  the 

principles  put  forward  by  Mendl  and  co-authors  (2010)  with  the  concurring  welfare 

definition of Spruijt and co-authors (2001) to create a schematic showing how welfare 

measurement can be broken down (Fig. 2). The objectives of the studies within this 

thesis  are  to  identify  potential  indicators  of  positive  and  negative  emotions  and 

possibly affective states in dolphins, through the combination of different categories 

of measures ('Triangulation': Webster, 2005), with the goal of facilitating evaluations 

of  the  “tilt  of  the  balance”  and  thus  overall  welfare  in  these  animals.  As  a  starting 

point, the next section reviews the few previous studies on dolphin welfare that have 

had similar objectives to the one described above.

(smaller  squares)  combine  to  form  affective  states  (larger  rectangles).  The  overall 

welfare of the animal is the balance of affective states i.e. the angle of the seesaw, 

and can move between negative, neutral and positive (Mendl et al., 2010; Panksepp, 

2011; Spruijt et al., 2001).  

Research on bottlenose dolphin welfare in captivity 

The  number  of  studies  that  have  directly  investigated  the  welfare  of 

bottlenose dolphins in captivity could almost be counted on one hand: we have very 

little  knowledge  on  how  to  measure  these  animals’  welfare  or  what  factors  might 

have an influence (Clegg et al., 2015; Ugaz et al., 2013). Given this fact, the review 

of the literature here has referenced any studies which are available on the topic in 

other dolphin species. There are 250 bottlenose dolphins in European Association of 

Zoos  and  Aquaria  facilities  (EAZA,  2015),  and  444  in  the  US  and  Canada  (Ceta-

base,  2011),  with  many  in  other  countries  not  on  official  registers,  and  all  kept  in  a 

wide  range  of  facilities  which  are  likely  to  differentially  impact  welfare  (Joseph  and 

Antrim,  2010).  Current  laws  regulate  the  resources  provided,  for  example  the  pool 

size or water quality (Animal Welfare Act, 1966; EC Council Directive, 1999), but are 

supported by very little scientific evidence and thus viewed as minimum requirements 

(Joseph  and  Antrim,  2010).  Clearly,  objective  research  is  needed  to  answer 

questions and aid policy makers on dolphin welfare in captivity, but up until now there 

has been very little conducted. 

 

The  first  work  directly  posing  questions  on  bottlenose  dolphin  welfare  were 

two  behavioural  investigations  conducted  over  two  decades  ago,  where  it  was 

suggested  that  dolphins  may  be  performing  stereotyped  swim  patterns  (Gygax, 

1993) and that behaviours such as play frequency and behavioural diversity might be 

indicators  of  welfare  (Galhardo  et  al.,  1996).  Around  the  same  time,  two  studies 

specifically  questioned  the  welfare  impacts  of  Swim-with-the-dolphin  (SWTD) 

programs, and found potential signs of disturbance to the animals but both concluded 

further work was needed (Frohoff and Packard, 1995; Samuels and Spradlin, 1995). 

A  decade  later,  another  study  using  similar  parameters  would  conclude  that  SWTD 

programs were not detrimental to dolphin welfare (Trone et al., 2005), and results on 

this aspect of captivity remain sparse yet conflicting. Although only consisting of case 

studies,  the  first  detailed  investigation  into  social  stress  and  its  welfare  implications 

for  captive  dolphins  was  published  a  few  years  later  (Waples  and  Gales,  2002).  In 

terms  of  physiological  welfare  indicators,  a  first  study  used  salivary  cortisol  to 

 

 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						16	

	
suggest that space of enclosure might impact bottlenose dolphin welfare (Ugaz et al., 

2013), and similar research was conducted using serum levels of stress hormones in 

belugas  (Delphinapterus  leucas)  where  it  was  found  that  out-of-water  veterinary 

examinations  caused  elevations  in  multiple  stress  hormone  levels  but  SWTD 

programs did not (Schmitt et al., 2010). An assay for faecal corticosteroid metabolites 

was  recently  developed  with  captive  bottlenose  dolphins  and  was  shown  to  be  a 

viable  indicator  of  adrenal  activity,  and  thus  could  be  useful  in  future  welfare 

investigations (Biancani et al., 2017). 

 

Although  welfare  questions  and  conclusions  were  made  in  these  previous 

studies, none of them followed the principles, approaches or terminology used by the 

general  animal  welfare  science  field,  e.g.  as  used  in  farm  animal  studies.  After  the 

start of this thesis, a study published a comprehensive, animal-based dolphin welfare 

framework (the “C-Well© Assessment”) (Clegg et al., 2015) that was adapted from a 

well-established  farm  animal  assessment  (WelfareQuality®,  2009a,b,c).  Thirty-six 

measures were developed and tested in three dolphin facilities, but the assessment 

was  not  fully  validated  in  terms  of  testing  the  relationship  between  the  parameters 

and  emotions  or  affective  states.  This  study  represented  the  first  application  of 

welfare science principles to dolphins in captivity and aimed to stimulate further work 

in the area (abstract provided in Appendix A.2.i).  

 

Of  course,  the  field  of  cetology  has  a  vast  knowledge  base  and  studies  are 

often published on aspects related to dolphin welfare, but do not mention the term or 

specifically  focus  on  it  (Hill  et  al.,  2016).  This  past  cetology  research  will  aid  in  the 

advancement towards measuring dolphin welfare, but as yet a comprehensive review 

of the related topics that would facilitate this has not been conducted. In the following 

sub-section,  I  discuss  the  cetology  disciplines  that  are  likely  to  be  most  relevant  by 

placing them in the Triangulation framework proposed for assessing welfare in other 

species (Webster, 2005), while also highlighting techniques from terrestrial research 

that have aided in discovering different types of welfare measures. As the first step of 

this project, a review of cetology knowledge relevant to welfare was published (Paper 

1,  Chapter  2)  in  order  to  identify  gaps  and  set  foundations  for  this  topic  (as 

recommended by Hill and Lackups, 2010).  

Potential health, behavioural and cognitive welfare measures 

For  the  much-needed  review  of  potential  dolphin  welfare  indicators,  which 

became the first project of this thesis, we adapted the ‘Triangulation’ concept slightly 

by  expanding  the  categories  of  measures  to  health,  behaviour  and  cognition,  for 

 

 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						17	

	
several  important  reasons.  First,  health  influences  welfare,  and  if  we  follow  current 

thinking  and  only  consider  conditions  where  the  animal  actually  “feels  ill”  (Boissy  et 

al.,  2007;  Mason  and  Veasey,  2010;  Veissier  et  al.,  2012),  using  more  than  just 

physiological  indicators  may  aid  in  assessing  welfare  holistically  and  move  away 

from measuring only discrete emotions (Mendl et al., 2010). Second, broadening the 

neurobiology  category  to  all  cognitive  processing  allows  the  inclusion  of  extremely 

useful  welfare  test  paradigms  developed  from  experimental  psychology  (chiefly 

cognitive bias, Mendl et al., 2009). Lastly, since our work represents the first steps in 

dolphin  welfare,  remaining  conservative  and  not  excluding  potential  influencing 

factors  through  using  limited  categories  would  be  prudent.  Dolphins  and  their 

environment  are  significantly  different  from  terrestrial  animals  and  our  existing 

knowledge, and thus there may be many other variables, unknown and intangible to 

us, which affect dolphin welfare (Delfour, 2006). 

 

Among the fields of health, behaviour and cognition of cetaceans, there is a 

relatively  large  knowledge  base  concerning  the  various  diseases  and  medical 

conditions  that  has  resulted  from  years  of  wild  and  captive  studies  (e.g.  Reif  et  al., 

2008; Venn-Watson et al., 2012). Nevertheless, dolphins tend to mask symptoms of 

poor health (Castellote and Fossa, 2006; Waples and Gales, 2002), so physiological 

parameters  are  likely  to  also  be  informative  about  welfare  states.  For  example 

cortisol  levels  have  potential  to  indicate  welfare  state,  as  has  been  shown  with 

terrestrial animals (e.g. Palme, 2012; Pifarré et al., 2012), but the early stage of this 

research with dolphin species has led to cautious interpretations thus far (Atkinson et 

al.,  2015;  Biancani  et  al.,  2017;  Ugaz  et  al.,  2013).  Inappetence  is  commonly 

correlated with poor health in dolphins and could be a useful welfare measure in the 

absence  of  other  symptoms:  it  is  a  basic  indicator  of  dolphin  ‘sickness  behaviour’ 

(Johnson et al., 2009; Schmitt and Sur, 2012) and is easy to monitor, but further work 

is  needed  to  disentangle  the  causes  which  can  be  behavioural  as  well  as  health-

related  (Waples  and  Gales,  2002).  Similar  to  the  general  poor  health  indicator  of 

inappetence,  Body  Condition  Scoring  (BCS)  can  be  a  useful  welfare  tool  which 

captures  longer-term  states  of  poor  (or  good)  health:  it  is  commonly  used  in  farm 

animal studies (e.g. Roche et al., 2009; WelfareQuality®, 2009a) and is starting to be 

applied to wild and captive dolphin species (Clegg et al., 2015; Joblon et al., 2014). 

Other external physical measures such as presence of bodily injuries are often used 

in farm animal welfare assessments (Mononen et al., 2012; WelfareQuality®, 2009b), 

since  they  simultaneously  measure  pain/infection  levels  as  well  as  aggression  rate; 

similar  measures  have  been  proposed  for  dolphin  welfare  evaluations  and  warrant 

further investigation (Clegg et al., 2015).  

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						18	

Behaviour  measurement  and  thus  ethology  is  essential  to  welfare  research 

(Dawkins,  2004;  Maple  and  Perdue,  2013),  and  the  information  yielded  is  generally 

thought  to  be  more  revealing  about  welfare  state  than  health  parameters  (Gonyou, 

1994; Joseph and Antrim, 2010). This is likely to be extremely applicable to dolphins 

due to their complex and flexible social structures increasing the occurrence of social 

stress as a welfare-reducing factor: this has been reported anecdotally but merits in-

depth investigation as it could have a major influence in captive dolphins’ lives where 

group composition is artificial and less changeable (Barrett and Würsig, 2014; Clegg 

et  al.,  2015;  Waples  and  Gales,  2002).  Estimating  the  frequency  of  aggressive 

behaviour is often part of terrestrial welfare assessments, for example in farmed pigs 

(Sus  scrofa)  through  the  occurrence  of  tail-biting  lesions  (Temple  et  al.,  2011). 

Aggressive  behaviour  in  dolphins  is  often  hard  to  observe  (often  occurs  at  fast 

speeds  underwater)  and  so  indicators  such  as  the  extent  of  rake  marks  (from 

conspecifics’  teeth)  have  been  shown  as  useful  proxy  measures  for  aggression 

(Marley et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2005), and were recently proposed as a measure of 

welfare  (Clegg  et  al.,  2015).  Dolphin  species’  capacity  for  close  social  relationships 

could  equally  provide  a  buffer  towards  stress  (Barrett  and  Würsig,  2014)  and  thus 

lead to improved welfare (Brando et al., 2016), as well as potentially compromising it 

through sustained aggression. Social behaviours linked to positive welfare might be 

gentle  tactile  behaviours,  synchronous  swimming  and  play  (respective  examples: 

Connor et al., 2006a; Kuczaj et al., 2013; Paulos et al., 2010), all of which have been 

described  as  affiliative  but  have  not  yet  been  studied  empirically  as  emotional 

indicators.  Inter-specific  social  behaviours,  such  as  Human-Animal  Interactions 

(HAIs) for captive dolphins, could also be very influential for their welfare, based on 

terrestrial  zoo  animal  research:  positive  HAIs  can  significantly  improve  welfare  and 

vice versa (Hosey and Melfi, 2010; Whitham and Wielebnowski, 2013). However this 

has hardly been studied with dolphins and proposed methods such as an approach-

avoidance test adapted from farm animals (Clegg et al., 2015) should be developed 

further,  especially  given  that  compared  to  other  non-domesticated  captive  animals, 

trainer-dolphin  interactions  are  likely  to  be  unique  in  terms  of  the  level  of  physical 

contact, the time spent in proximity each day, and the simulated working relationship 

(Galhardo et al., 1996; Maple and Perdue, 2013). In general, positive intra- or inter-

specific  social  interactions  have  the  potential  to  be  indicators  of  positive  emotions, 

but  also  to  move  an  animal’s  balance  of  affective  states  towards  the  positive  side 

(Rault,  2012);  therefore,  increasing  opportunities  for  these  behaviours  to  occur  can 

be  thought  of  as  a  tool  to  improve  welfare  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007).  Another  behaviour 

warranting  investigation  is  abnormal  repetitive  behaviour,  which  is  not  often  studied 

	
 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						19	

	
and  poorly  understood  in  dolphins,  despite  anecdotal  evidence  supporting  its 

occurrence  (review  by  Clark,  2013).  Lastly,  evidence  from  wild  and  captive  studies 

show  that  certain  parameters  of  the  vocal  behaviour  of  dolphin  species  are 

undoubtedly  linked  to  their  emotional  state  (e.g.  Dibble  et  al.,  2016;  Herzing,  2000) 

and  thus  could  be  invaluable  to  welfare  studies,  but  so  far  we  know  relatively  little 

about  which  emotions  certain  vocalisations  might  indicate  due  to  problems  with 

identifying  the  sound-emitting  dolphin  (Herzing,  1996).  Fortunately,  new  technology 

and  etho-acoustical  approaches  are  actively  addressing  this  issue  and  the  first 

results  look  promising  in  terms  of  discovering  the  meaning  behind  dolphin 

vocalisations (Lopez Marulanda et al., 2016, 2017). 

 

The  third  category  within  which  dolphin  welfare  measures  should  be 

established is cognition i.e. the cognitive components of emotional responses, which 

significantly  help  to  decipher  the  valence  of  emotions  (Paul  et  al.,  2005).  Cognitive 

processes have been shown to influence emotions through the appraisal of external 

stimuli, and emotional states can impact cognitive functioning by inducing attentional, 

memory and judgement biases (collectively ‘cognitive bias’) (Mendl and Paul, 2004; 

Paul  et  al.,  2005).  Cognitive  biases  represent  perhaps  the  most  promising  tool  for 

measuring  welfare  in  recent  years,  since  testing  animals’  biases,  where  ambiguous 

cues elicit either positively or negatively biased decisions, has proven to be a reliable 

measure  of  an  individual’s  affective  state  (latest  reviews  by  Baciadonna  and 

McElligott, 2015; Roelofs et al., 2016). Cognitive bias testing will be discussed further 

in  terms  of  its  applicability  to  dolphins  in  the  following  sub-section.  The  other  main 

cognitive  phenomenon  discussed  in  relation  to  welfare  is  laterality,  since  many 

studies  have  found  that  due  to  hemispheric  specialisations  individuals  show 

preferences  towards  the  left  or  right  eye  or  body  part  in  different  situations,  with 

some theories going further to suggest that this is related to emotional regulation and 

thus  welfare  (Leliveld  et  al.,  2013;  Rogers,  2010;  with  Tursiops  truncatus:  Delfour 

and  Marten,  2006;  Sakai  et  al.,  2006).  More  work  is  needed  before  standardised 

welfare  conclusions  can  be  drawn,  but  lateralised  behaviours  are  certainly  worth 

investigating  as  the  data  are  feasible  to  collect  and  could  be  correlated  with  other 

potential parameters. 

After  this  overview  of  the  types  of  measures  likely  to  be  relevant  to  dolphin 

welfare, it can now be considered how they might be experimentally tested in order 

to prove their accuracy and validity.

Welfare tests applicable to dolphins  

Cognitive bias testing 

 

In  the  early  days  of  animal  welfare  science,  perhaps  due  to  resistance  in 

accepting  the  presence  of  emotions  in  animals  (Shettleworth,  2001),  welfare 

measures were identified by exposing subjects to unquestionably negative situations 

or  making  pharmacological  modifications,  and  then  recording  behavioural  and 

physiological parameters as indicators of poor welfare  (Boissy and Bouissou, 1995; 

Makowska  and  Weary,  2013).  As  demonstrated  by  these  relatively  uncomplicated 

approaches,  it  is  easier  to  measure  indicators  of  ‘discrete’  emotions  like  fear  and 

anxiety than more complex or positive states (Mendl et al., 2010; Paul et al., 2005). 

Complex  emotions  e.g.  depressed,  and  affective  states  (combinations  of  emotions) 

are  measured  using  detailed  experimental  protocols  and  require  consideration  of 

cognitive  processes:  the  goal  here  is  to  measure  the  valence  dimension  of  affect, 

whereas with the simpler, discrete emotions the level of arousal is usually sufficient 

for evaluations (Mendl et al., 2010).  

 

Tests  of  cognitive  biases  allow  measurement  of  the  valence  of  affective 

states:  results  from  numerous  judgement  bias  studies  show  that  when  humans  or 

animals are placed in poorer environments or chronic stress is stimulated they make 

more  pessimistic  judgements,  and  when  they  experience  for  example  enriched 

surroundings or positive social groupings they judge more optimistically (reviews on 

humans:  MacLeod  and  Byrne,  1996;  Wright  and  Bower,  1992;  and  other  animals: 

Baciadonna  and  McElligott,  2015;  Mendl  et  al.,  2009;  Roelofs  et  al.,  2016).  While 

research on this topic has increased exponentially in the last few years, there are still 

gaps in the knowledge: for example, there have been cases where the directionality 

of  results  is  not  as  predicted  (i.e.  optimistic  judgements  are  not  correlated  to  better 

welfare)  (Bethell,  2015;  Mendl  et  al.,  2009).  A  common  explanation  is  that  the 

animal’s  current  mood  and  affective  state,  occurring 

independently  of  any 

experimental manipulations, is the cause for the unexpected biases (Baciadonna and 

McElligott,  2015;  Wichman  et  al.,  2012).  Instead  of  viewing  this  as  a  problem  in 

cognitive bias studies, future work may be able to help identify measures of affective 

state  by  just  studying  the  animals  in  their  “home  environment”.  For  example  it  was 

suggested  recently  to  use  bias  tests  to  fully  explore  correlations  with  social 

behaviours,  which  for  social  species  are  likely  to  significantly  impact  affective  state 

(Wichman  et  al.,  2012).  Results  from  the  first  few  studies  investigating  this  already 

show  a  clear  link:  domestic  canaries  (Serinus  canaria)  judged  more  optimistically 

when  pair-housed  (as  opposed  to  those  housed  singly)  (Lalot  et  al.,  2017),  and 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						21	

	
optimistic  judgements  in  two  primate  species  were  likely  linked  to  dominance 

behaviour (Bateson and Nettle, 2015; Schino et al., 2016). Cognitive bias testing had 

not  yet  been  applied  to  any  marine  mammal  or  zoo-housed  species  prior  to  the 

publication of our study (Chapter 3, Papers 3 and 4): bottlenose dolphins are highly 

trainable using positive reinforcement methods (Brando, 2010) and in the wild live in 

complex  fission-fusion  social  networks  (Connor  et  al.,  2001),  therefore  representing 

an interesting model for cognitive bias questions.  

Anticipatory behaviour and reward sensitivity 

Although  it  has  garnered  less  research  thus  far,  another  current  welfare 

paradigm which seems to indicate affective states is the performance of anticipatory 

behaviour  before  a  predictable  reward.  This  is  defined  as  the  behavioural  patterns 

established in preparation for a predictable, upcoming positive event, and is linked to 

affective states in two ways. Firstly, it has been shown in many species that animals 

will  perform  a  certain  level  of  anticipatory  behaviour  before  a  reward  and  that  this 

anticipation  in  itself  stimulates  positive  emotional  states  (van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt, 

2007; Watters, 2014), as evidenced through behavioural (e.g. Anderson et al., 2015; 

McGrath et al., 2016) and physiological (e.g. Gimsa et al., 2012; Opiol et al., 2015) 

indicators. Secondly, it has been theorised that an animal’s affective state can further 

be  deduced  by  the  connection  between  anticipatory  behaviour  and  the  reward-

sensitivity system (Spruijt et al., 2001; van der Harst and Spruijt, 2007). This theory 

was  developed  from  multidisciplinary  research  into  the  brain’s  reward-evaluating 

mechanisms,  where  it  was  found  that  an  individual’s  sensitivity  (i.e.  ‘want’/desire) 

regarding  a  reward  is  continuously  changing  (adaptive  response  to  help  fulfil  needs 

and  increase  positive  experiences)  (van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007).  Using  the 

simple example of food acquisition, if a food reward appears reliably after a cue, an 

animal  will  show  some  level  of  anticipatory  behaviour  after  perceiving  the  cue, 

assuming  that  it  is  not  fed  ad  libitum  and  thus  not  satiated.  However,  if  the  animal 

has not been fed for days and is very hungry and thus in a negative affective state, it 

will  place  more  value  on  the  food  reward  (‘incentive  value’)  and  therefore  perform 

more  anticipatory  behaviour  before  its  arrival.  This  also  applies  for  negative  and 

positive  experiences  unrelated  to  each  other:  for  example,  an  animal  in  a  barren, 

under-stimulating  environment  would  be  predicted  to  anticipate  food  rewards  more. 

This  has  been  proven  with  laboratory  rats  (Rattus  norvegicus)  (Makowska  and 

Weary, 2016; van der Harst et al., 2003a), and furthermore it was shown that socially 

isolated  rats  anticipate  food  rewards  as  well  as  social  contact  more  than  group-

housed conspecifics (van den Berg et al., 1999). In terms of the relationship between 

 

 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						22	

	
the  levels  of  stress  and  anticipatory  behaviour  for  a  reward,  and  how  we  might  use 

this  to  predict  welfare,  a  recent  study  proposed  that  an  animal  with  positively-

balanced  welfare  and  low  stress  will  still  perform  a  certain  level  of  anticipation,  and 

as stress increases so does anticipatory behaviour, until a threshold of chronic stress 

is  reached  beyond  which  anticipatory  behaviour  is  almost  totally  suppressed  as  the 

animal experiences a state of apathy and helplessness (Watters, 2014). 

 

More  cross-species  research  into  anticipatory  behaviour  as  an  indicator  of 

affective  state  is  needed,  since  many  elements  remain  unclear:  for  example,  does 

increased  anticipation  result  in  increased  participation  or  consummatory  activity  in 

the  reward  once  it  arrives?  This  question  has  not  yet  been  the  focus  of  any  study, 

and  past  descriptive  results  would  suggest  that  this  is  the  case  (Anderson  et  al., 

2015;  McGrath  et  al.,  2016),  but  perhaps  situations  where  animals  anticipate  a 

reward strongly, but then do not exploit or utilise it, have different implications for the 

individual’s  welfare  state.  In  addition,  the  act  of  anticipating  can  itself  be  rewarding, 

and  thus  should  be  investigated  in  terms  of  interaction  with  the  reward’s  incentive 

value  and  the  deduced  affective  state  (van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007;  Watters, 

2014). Nevertheless, anticipatory behaviour is relatively simple to measure and thus 

should be investigated in a variety of species and settings: including dolphin species 

in  captivity.  The  only  study  in  captive  dolphins  on  this  behaviour  empirically 

confirmed  the  presence  of  anticipatory  behaviour,  where  a  group  of  T.  truncatus 

performed  more  surface  vigilance  behaviours  in  response  to  the  upcoming  public 

presentation  sessions  during  which  their  food  was  provided  (Jensen  et  al.,  2013). 

Since  anticipatory  behaviour  levels  can  be  used  to  understand  which  objects  and 

events  might  be  rewarding  for  captive  animals  (van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007),  it 

could  also  be  applied  to  bottlenose  dolphins  in  order  to  discover  what  elements  of 

their environment they find rewarding: so far, we know only that they will voluntarily 

interact with enrichment items (Delfour and Beyer, 2012; Kuczaj et al., 2002) but not 

whether and how they value such items (Delfour et al., 2017). One study has shown 

that  captive  bottlenose  dolphins  voluntarily  sought  tactile  contact  from  familiar 

humans  (Perelberg  and  Schuster,  2009)  but  again  more  information  on  how  the 

animals perceive Human-Animal Interactions (HAIs), perhaps through their levels of 

anticipation for such events, would be instrumental to welfare discussions. 

Practical application of welfare tools 

The  cognitive  bias  and  anticipatory  behaviour  ‘tests’  of  affective  state 

presented  above  require  time  and  effort  since  they  must  be  conducted  as  part  of 

 

 

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						23	

	
rigorously  controlled  studies.  In  general,  feasible  and  inexpensive  methods  to 

regularly monitor behaviour or health are relatively more useful to animal managers 

in  terms  of  making  changes  to  the  system  to  improve  welfare  (Maple  and  Perdue, 

2013;  Napolitano  et  al.,  2010),  and  I  discuss  one  such  approach  here.  Qualitative 

Behavioural  Assessments  (QBA)  are  conducted  when  an  observer  makes  a 

qualitative  evaluation  of  an  anima’s  emotional  expressivity  by  considering  and 

integrating  many  aspects  of  its  behaviour,  which  in  conventional  quantitative 

approaches  are  recorded  separately  or  not  at  all  (Wemelsfelder,  2007).  In  practice 

QBAs  ask  questions  about  the  expressive  demeanour  of  the  animal  either  using 

freechoice profiling, where observers provide their own terms regarding the animal’s 

behaviour,  or  consist  of  fixed  rating  scales  with  pre-determined  descriptions  where 

the  observer  chooses  a  grade  (Wemelsfelder  and  Lawrence,  2001).  Although 

seemingly  very  subjective,  such  observer  ratings  can  amalgamate  multimodal 

information  across  time  and  situations  in  a  way  that  one-dimensional  quantitative 

data does not (Meagher, 2009; Wemelsfelder and Mullan, 2014). Numerous studies 

have  reported  strong  inter-observer  concordance  (even  with  different  levels  of 

expertise, Wemelsfelder et al., 2012), and it was found that the QBA results can be 

correlated  with  quantified  behaviours  as  well  as  physiological  markers  of  stress 

(Rutherford  et  al.,  2012;  Stockman  et  al.,  2011;  Wemelsfelder  and  Mullan,  2014; 

Wickham  et  al.,  2012).  QBAs  have  been  successfully  applied  in  zoo  settings  to 

measure  personality  traits  and  welfare  of  zoo  animals,  as  measured  through 

significant  correlations  of  the  QBA  results  and  other  objective  welfare  indicators 

(Carlstead  et  al.,  1999;  Meagher,  2009;  Weiss  et  al.,  2006;  Whitham  and 

Wielebnowski, 2009). Outside of being used for ratings in personality studies, QBA-

style approaches have not been conducted in dolphin emotion studies. Since animal 

caretakers  are  widely  considered  to  be  most  knowledgeable  about  their  charges’ 

behaviour  and  spend  the  most  time  with  them  (Meagher,  2009;  Whitham  and 

Wielebnowski,  2009),  and  dolphin  trainers  are  no  exception,  there  is  the  scope  to 

establish  a  qualitative  tool  to  monitor  dolphin  behaviour  and/or  overall  welfare. 

Furthermore,  an  easily  applicable  record-taking  practice  such  as  this  would  be 

valuable  for  the  zoo  management  and  scientists  alike.  For  example,  a  dolphin’s 

behaviour  during  the  multiple  daily  training  sessions  they  experience  is  likely  to 

reflect  their  affective  state  in  measureable  ways,  but  as  yet  no  studies  have 

investigated  this  (Brando  et  al.,  2016).  Recently  a  QBA  was  designed  to  answer  a 

similar question on horse welfare during endurance riding (Fleming et al., 2013) and 

thus the same approach could be applied to dolphins during training sessions.  

	

Chapter	1:	General	Introduction						24	

Although  the  animal  welfare  literature  presented  above  covers  many 

disciplines, being rich in some areas but significantly lacking in others, its underlying 

principles  are  applicable  to  all  species  and  therefore  bottlenose  dolphins  are  more 

than  viable  candidates  for  such  investigations.  There  may  even  be  potential  for 

dolphin  welfare  studies  to  enhance  general  animal  welfare  knowledge:  their 

capabilities in learning trained tasks and their wide range of inter- and intra-specific 

social  behaviours  could  allow  the  development  of  paradigms  applicable  to  other 

species.  There  is  a  strong  need  for  dolphin  welfare  research  in  terms  of  its 

applications to the management of animals in public display facilities, as well as the 

subsequent  transmission  of  information  to  the  general  public  and  regulatory  bodies 

(Clegg et al., 2015). Progress on dolphin welfare assessment techniques would also 

be  applicable  to  some  contexts  with  wild  populations  and  could  aid  in  conservation 

programs (Papastavrou et al., 2017; Paquet and Darimont, 2010).   

Aim and outline of the thesis 

The  aim  of  this  thesis  was  to  develop  animal-based  measures  of  bottlenose 

dolphin  welfare  in  captivity.  This  project  was  facilitated  through  a  collaboration 

between  Parc  Astérix  and  the  Laboratoire  d’Ethologie  Expérimentale  et  Comparée 

(LEEC),  Université  Paris  13,  with  the  support  of  a  CIFRE  scholarship,  Association 

Nationale  de  la  Recherche  et  de  la  Technologie)  and  a  Universities  Federation  for 

Animal Welfare (UFAW) grant. The studies were conducted at Parc Astérix (France), 

Planète Sauvage (France) and Dolfinarium Harderwijk (the Netherlands). Three main 

questions, and a fourth concerning the implementation of a welfare tool, were asked 

(corresponding to Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5; see Fig. 3). Since very little data existed on 

dolphin welfare, the first question was:  

 

Which behavioural and other parameters are likely to have the most potential 

for  measuring  welfare?  Firstly,  a  comprehensive  review  was  conducted  of  all 

cetology  sub-topics  related  to  dolphin  welfare,  since  this  was  not  present  in  the 

literature  (Paper  1).  A  study  was  then  carried  out  among  four  groups  of  dolphins  in 

international  facilities  to  investigate  the  variation  of  selected  potential  behaviours 

welfare  measures  in  response  to  the  timings  of  daily  training  sessions  (Paper  2). 

Chapter  2  is  comprised  of  these  two  studies,  where  the  common  goal  was  to 

highlight the most likely areas where welfare measures might be found. Using these 

findings, Chapter 3 aimed to answer the question of:  

Are  frequencies  of  potential  behavioural  measures  of  welfare  correlated  to 

individual  differences  in  cognitive  biases?  A  spatial  location  judgement  task  for

terrestrial  species  was  adapted  for  the  first  time  to  dolphins,  and  cognitive  bias 

results  were  correlated  to  the  frequency  of  social  behaviours,  selected  for  their 

potential links to welfare, observed around the time of testing and in the few months 

before (Paper 3). We expected that synchronous swimming and social play might be 

correlated to optimistic judgements (considered affiliative, Kuczaj et al., 2013; Paulos 

et  al.,  2010),  and  that  agonistic  behaviour  might  link  to  pessimistic  judgements  if 

indeed such behaviour indicates reduced welfare (as proposed for terrestrial species, 

(Broom  and  Johnson,  1993).  In  a  follow-up  study,  the  frequency  of  anticipatory 

behaviour towards upcoming training sessions was also measured and correlated to 

cognitive bias results (Paper 4): based on the reward-sensitivity theory (Spruijt et al., 

2001;  van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007)  it  was  predicted  that  the  highest  levels  of 

anticipation  would  be  linked  to  the  most  pessimistic  biases.  Continuing  with  our 

investigation of anticipatory behaviour, the third question of the thesis and the subject 

of Chapter 4 was:  

 

What  events  do  the  bottlenose  dolphins  anticipate  in  their  environment,  and 

does  anticipation  reflect  event  participation?  Due  to  purported  links  with  affective 

state  and  earlier  results  in  this  thesis,  anticipatory  behaviour  showed  potential  as  a 

measure of welfare and a certain level is thought to indicate what the animal “wants” 

in  its  environment  (Watters,  2014).  Furthermore,  it  had  not  yet  been  studied  in  any 

species whether the level of anticipation reflects participation in the predicted event, 

but we predicted that this would be the case. For this study, a Pavlovian conditioning 

paradigm was used to test the dolphins’ anticipation before the occurrence of toys in 

the  pool,  a  Human-Animal  Interaction  (HAI),  or  a  feeding  session,  and  their 

subsequent participation in these situations (Paper 5).  

 

Lastly,  Chapter  5  includes  a  long-term  study  that  was  carried  out  in  five 

facilities  housing  six  bottlenose  dolphin  groups  where  qualitative  ratings  of  dolphin 

motivation during training and other welfare data were taken daily over a year (Paper 

6).  This  was  conducted  to  answer  the  question  of:  Can  qualitative  ratings  of 

motivation,  social  behaviour  markers  and  health-related  data  be  correlated  to 

develop an applicable, holistic welfare tool for dolphins? Due to time constraints and 

the participation of as many facilities in the project, the results are not yet available 

and  a  short  methodology  only  will  be  presented  in  this  thesis.  There  follows  a 

discussion of the work in Chapter 6 where the likely indicators of welfare for dolphins 

are discussed, and future directions highlighted.

Résumé 

La  science  du  bien-être  animal  est  un  domaine  en  pleine  expansion,  mais  la 

recherche sur les cétacés (baleines, dauphins et marsouins) fait défaut. Les grands 

dauphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  sont  les  cétacés  les  plus  connus  et  les  plus  étudiés, 

particulièrement  en  captivité,  et  ils  sont  utilisés  dans  cette  revue  de  la  littérature 

comme un modèle pour d'autres espèces de cétacés. Malgré l'intérêt du public et le 

besoin  d'une  telle  recherche,  des  études  qui  spécifiquement  examinent  le  bien-être 

des  dauphins  manquent.  Cette  revue  utilise  les  trois  catégories  générales  du 

comportement, de la santé et de la cognition, pour discuter comment le bien-être des 

dauphins a été évalué jusqu'à présent, et comment il pourrait être évalué à l'avenir. 

Nous  présentons  des  indicateurs  de  bien-être  validés  dans  d'autres  espèces  qui 

pourraient être appliqués aux dauphins, y compris des mesures innovantes comme 

l'évaluation  cognitive  des  émotions.  Nous 

fournissons  un 

résumé  de 

recommandations  pratiques  pour  valider  les  indicateurs  de  bien-être  des  grands 

dauphins.  Ce  papier  vise  à  stimuler  des  recherches  plus  approfondies  sur  le  bien-

être des dauphins qui pourraient améliorer la vie des animaux eux-mêmes et étayer 

des  décisions  réglementaires.  Nous  recommandons  d'unir  l'expertise  en  cétologie 

avec  la  science  du  bien-être  animal  pour  développer  une  approche  holistique  de 

l'évaluation du bien-être des dauphins.

Abstract 

 Animal  welfare  science  is  a  burgeoning  field,  but  research  on  cetaceans  (whales, 

dolphins and porpoises) is lacking. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are the 

most well-known and studied cetaceans, particularly in captivity, and thus are used in 

this  review  as  a  model  for  other  cetacean  species.  Despite  the  public  interest  and 

need for such research, studies specifically investigating dolphin welfare are lacking. 

This  review  uses  the  three  broad  categories  of  behaviour,  health,  and  cognition,  to 

discuss how dolphin welfare has been assessed thus far, and could be assessed in 

future. We present welfare indicators validated in other species that could be applied 

to dolphins, including innovative measures such as cognitive appraisal of emotions. 

We provide a summary of practical recommendations for validating the indicators of 

bottlenose dolphin welfare. This paper aims to stimulate further research into dolphin 

welfare  which  could  improve  the  lives  of  the  animals  themselves  and  ultimately 

support  regulatory  decisions.  We  recommend  uniting  expertise  in  cetology  and 

welfare  science  in  order  to  develop  a  holistic  approach  to  dolphin  welfare 

assessment.

1.  Introduction 

Research into welfare assessments for zoo and aquarium (hereafter referred 

to as ‘zoo’) animals is increasing as farm animal welfare assessment is proven to be 

feasible and valid (Barber, 2009; Whitham and Wielebnowski, 2013). There is much 

support for the adaptation of farm animal measures to zoo animals (Hill and Broom, 

2009;  Mason  and  Veasey,  2010;  Swaisgood,  2007),  and  zoological  institutions  are 

well set-up for conducting measures due to the individualised care and multiple daily 

interactions (Barber, 2009). 

 

In  this  review,  we  conceptualise  welfare  using  Spruijt  et  al.’s  (2001) 

description  of  a  “…balance  between  positive  (reward,  satisfaction)  and  negative 

(stress) experiences or affective states. The balance may range from positive (good 

welfare)  to  negative  (poor  welfare)”.  This  “feelings-based”  definition  aligns  with 

positions taken recently by many others (e.g. Fraser and Duncan, 1998; Mason and 

Veasey, 2010; Watters, 2014; Yeates and Main, 2008), and specifies measurement 

of both positive and negative welfare. Our review also prioritises animal-based over 

resource-based  measures,  since  they  are  more  likely  to  accurately  reflect  welfare 

(Roe et al., 2011; Webster, 2005; Whitham and Wielebnowski, 2013). We also give 

equal consideration to indicators of positive and negative welfare (Boissy et al., 2007; 

Désiré et al., 2002; Paul et al., 2005; Yeates and Main, 2008).  

 

There is very little existing research on the welfare of cetaceans (Clegg et al., 

2015;  Ugaz  et  al.,  2013),  in  captivity  or  the  wild.  Given  that  public  interest  often 

stimulates research in the associated areas (e.g. with farm animal welfare, Rushen et 

al., 2011), cetacean welfare studies are likely to increase markedly in the near future 

since  the  public’s  interest  is  at  a  high  level  and  intensity  (Grimm,  2011;  Ventre  and 

Jett,  2015).  Although  many  questions  posed  are  in  fact  ethical  dilemmas  (e.g. 

“Should we keep dolphins in captivity?”), objective data on the animals’ welfare state 

would  aid  in  these  personal  decisions  (Clegg  et  al.,  2015;  Jiang  et  al.,  2007). 

Published  farm  welfare  assessments  have  shown  how  this  type  of  data  can  be 
gathered, for instance the WelfareQuality® project for farm animals (WelfareQuality®, 

2009a,b,c)  and  its  subsequent  cross-species  adaptations  (e.g.  Barnard  and  Ferri, 

2015;  Clegg et al., 2015; Mononen et al., 2012;). 

While  cetology,  the  study  of  cetaceans,  has  burgeoned  (Hill  and  Lackups, 

2010),  there  are  very  few  studies  on  cetacean  welfare  and  methods  of  assessment 

(Clark, 2013; Clegg et al., 2015; Galhardo et al., 1996; Ugaz et al., 2013). Bottlenose 

dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  are  the  most  studied  cetacean  species  (Hill  and 

Lackups,  2010),  and  the  most  common  in  captivity  (Pryor  and  Norris,  1998;  Wells 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						33	

	
and Scott, 1999), thus we choose them as the focus species for this review of how 

welfare  science  could  be  applied  to  cetaceans.  We  arrange  the  relevant  cetology 

knowledge into behaviour, health-related and cognition research, all well-established 

specialities (Wells, 2009). These three categories are derived from Webster’s (2005) 

‘Triangulation’  principle  for  the  measurement  of  welfare,  where  accumulating 

information  from  each  specialty  increases  overall  validity.  Importantly,  while  our 

review includes wild research and welfare applications (wild animal welfare should be 

measured:  Jordan,  2005;  Ohl  and  van  der  Staay,  2012),  our  discussions  orientate 

towards  captive  dolphins  since  their  environment  is  closely  controlled  by  humans. 

The necessity for dolphin welfare research is clear: there are 250 bottlenose dolphins 

in  the  European  Association  of  Zoos  and  Aquaria  facilities  (EAZA,  2015),  444 

animals listed in US and Canadian dolphinaria (Ceta-base, 2011), and many others 

worldwide  not  registered  on  an  official  record,  all  maintained  in  a  huge  range  of 

facility types that differentially impact welfare (Joseph and Antrim, 2010). 

This  review  compiles  what  we  believe  to  be  literature  on  wild  and  captive 

bottlenose dolphins most relevant to welfare, suggesting some farm and zoo animal 

approaches  which  could  be  adapted  to  cetaceans,  with  final  recommendations  on 

initial studies and how the dolphin welfare discipline might evolve. A strong focus is 

maintained  on  those  areas  of  cetology  that  merit  further  investigation  to  answer 

questions on bottlenose dolphins’ quality of life.  

2.  Published Work on Dolphin Welfare 

There  are  very  few  studies  of  dolphin  welfare,  either  in  captivity  or  the  wild 

(Clegg  et  al.,  2015;  Ugaz  et  al.,  2013).  Thus  there  are  no  validated  measures,  i.e. 

ones  that  we  know  are  linked  to  positive  or  negative  affective  states,  as  yet.  Given 

the dearth of welfare research, in some cases findings from other cetacean species 

are extrapolated to bottlenose dolphins. 

2.1 Studies of wild dolphin welfare 

Very few studies discuss the concept of wild cetacean welfare, but there are a 

handful which essentially aim to assess welfare even if direct mentioning of the word 

is  rare.  A  popular  topic  has  been  assessments  of  the  impacts  of  tourist  boats  on 

various  cetacean  species  (e.g.  Christiansen  and  Lusseau,  2015;  Stockin  et  al., 

2008),  although  the  focus  remains  at  population-level  indicators.  Long-term  data 

revealed  that  rate  and  repetitions  of  wild  bottlenose  dolphin  whistles  were  potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						34	

	
indicators  of  short-term  stress  (Esch  et  al.,  2009).  A  more  recent  study  suggested 

that an upward shift in whistle frequency was linked to increased emotional arousal 

(Heiler et al., 2016). Butterworth et al. (2013) empirically evaluated dolphin welfare in 

the  Taiji  drive  hunts,  an  annual  harvesting  of  dolphins  in  Japan,  but  this  research 

only  concentrated  on  welfare  at  the  point  of  death.  In  the  first  and  only  teaming  of 

wild  marine  mammal  research  with  animal  welfare  science  to  our  knowledge, 

Butterworth et al. (2012) used the five freedoms to discuss how entanglement affects 

individual animal welfare in a number of species, including dolphins. 

2.2 Studies measuring captive dolphin welfare  

Similarly,  there  are  only  a  handful  of  captive  dolphin  studies  that  have 

endeavoured  to  develop  welfare  measures.  Ugaz  et  al.  (2013)  correlated  salivary 

cortisol  to  behavioural  parameters  in  23  T.  truncatus,  concluding  that  welfare  was 

better  in  open  (enclosed  area  of  the  sea)  than  closed  (artificial  water  and  pool) 

facilities  due  to  lower  cortisol  levels  and  less  floating  and  circular  swimming. 

Castellote  and  Fossa  (2006)  suggested  acoustic  activity  as  a  welfare  measure  for 

belugas  (Delphinapterus  leucas)  and  found  it  dropped  to  low  levels  during  stressful 

events,  but  they  did  not  correlate  it  with  other  parameters  and  only  studied  two 

animals.  In  a  multidisciplinary  approach,  Waples  and  Gales  (2002)  looked  at 

inappetence, social behaviour, lethargy, weight loss and blood parameters in three T. 

truncatus with substantially deteriorating welfare likely due to social stress, revealing 

useful associations although again limited by sample size.  

 
2.3 The C-Well© Assessment: Clegg et al., (2015)  

 

In  the  first  development  of  a  welfare  assessment  for  dolphins,  Clegg  et  al., 

(2015) studied 20 T. truncatus in three facilities and adapted a well-established farm 
animal  assessment  (WelfareQuality®,  2009a,b,c)  to  this  species  (the  C-Well© 

Assessment).  The  research  used  36  multi-dimensional  measures,  58%  of  which 

were animal-based, to yield individual welfare scores comparable on many different 

levels  (e.g.  by  measure,  criteria,  in  total;  among  pools,  sex,  age  class,  facilities). 

Although the measures were unweighted, they were validated through expert opinion 

and application in specific contexts, and have associated standardised methods and 

thresholds. Some are reviewed in the relevant categories of section 3. 

Given  the  lack  of  existing  studies  on  dolphin  welfare  indicators,  the  next 

section  is  a  review  of  cetology  disciplines  relevant  to  welfare.  We  expanded 

Webster’s  (2005)  welfare  measurement  categories  to  behaviour,  health  (from 

Webster’s  ‘physiology’)  and  cognition  (from  ‘neurobiology’).  Health,  while  still 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						35	

	
including  physiology,  encompasses  longer-term  welfare  indicators,  and  cognition 

includes  experimental  psychology  methods  potentially  valuable  for  assessing 

welfare.  

3. Research Relevant to Dolphin Welfare 

3.1  Health  

3.1.1  Health-Welfare interface 

Health  and  welfare  interact  directly  and  indirectly  as  part  of  a  complex 

relationship  (Walker  et  al.,  2012).  A  reasonable  level  of  health  is  considered  a 

prerequisite  for  good  animal  welfare  (Hill  and  Broom,  2009;  Webster,  2005),  while 

poor  health  is  a  likely  contributing  factor  to  poor  welfare  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007; 

Dawkins,  2004;  Fraser  et  al.,  1997;  Mason  and  Veasey,  2010).  But  do  all 

components of poor health affect welfare? We refer back to our definition of welfare 

(Spruijt  et  al.,  2001)  to  address  this:  the  balance  of  affective  states  and  health  and 

should  only  be  impacted  when  poor  health  either  directly  impacts  affective  state 

through, for example, nausea, lethargy or pain, or indirectly through loss of function. 

Poor health (e.g. an asymptomatic tumor) does not always affect emotional state and 

hence welfare, as we define it (Fraser et al., 1997; Mason and Veasey, 2010).  

3.1.2 Health parameters in dolphins 

An  infection  or  disease  can  cause  pain  and/or  ‘sickness  behaviour’,  which 

includes  inappetence,  lethargy,  depression,  and  anti-social  behaviours,  all  of  which 

have  direct  or  indirect  effects  on  affective  state  (Broom,  1991;  Millman,  2007; 

Sneddon  et  al.,  2014).  Dolphins  tend  to  mask  symptoms  of  pain  and  disease  as  a 

survival  adaptation  (Castellote  and  Fossa,  2006;  Waples  and  Gales,  2002),  which 

therefore may only become obvious when the health problem is severe. Perhaps as 

a  consequence,  little  is  published  about  indicators  of  pain  in  dolphins,  with 

exceptions  for  extreme  situations  such  as  their  behavioural  response  to  killing 

methods in the wild (Butterworth et al., 2013). Weary et al. (2006) and Sneddon et al. 

(2014)  provide  cross-species  advice  for  identifying  behavioural  and  physiological 

pain  markers,  such  as  studying  behavioural  differences  after  analgesia 

administration. Inappetence and lethargy in dolphins have been correlated with many 

different  diseases  and  together  are  generally  reliable  as  poor  health  indicators 

(Johnson  et  al.,  2009;  Joseph  et  al.,  1986).  However  they  can  also  be  caused  by 

social stress or even reproductive events such as oestrus (Waples and Gales, 2002), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						36	

	
where the associated affective states may vary from negative to positive. Studies on 

the  behavioural  and  haematological  characteristics  of 

inappetence,  where 

differentiations  are  made  depending  on  whether  it  was  caused  by  poor  health  or 

social stressors, are much needed.   

 

In lieu of reliable pain indicators, physical bodily damage has been used as a 

health-related  welfare  measure  in  other  captive  species  (Broom,  1991;  Mononen  et 
al., 2012; WelfareQuality®, 2009a,b,c), and for wild animals as well (e.g. Cattet et al., 

2008;  Jordan,  2005).  Clegg  et  al.  (2015)  proposed  the  percentage  of  rake  marks 

(superficial lesions and scars caused by conspecifics in play, sexual and aggressive 

behaviours,  Scott  et  al.,  2005)  on  the  body  as  a  welfare  measure  for  bottlenose 

dolphins,  since  such  marks  can  be  used  as  a  proxy  indicator  of  aggression  levels 

and  social  stress  (Orbach  et  al.,  2015;  Scott  et  al.,  2005).  However,  this  measure 

requires further investigation for example to differentiate rake mark levels due to high 

levels of play and aggression while controlling for age and sex differences. 

 

Longer-term  measures  of  dolphin  health  could  also  be  useful  for  assessing 

welfare.  Body  condition  scoring  (BCS),  an  assessment  of  the  extent  of  body  fat 

present (Roche et al., 2009), has been favoured as a general welfare measure (e.g. 

wild:  Cattet  et  al.,  2008;  Mann  and  Kemps,  2003;  Pettis  et  al.,  2004;  captive: 
Mononen  et  al.,  2012;  Roche  et  al.,  2009;  WelfareQuality®,  2009a,b,c;)  and  it  has 

already  been  used  in  wild  health  assessments  of  T.  truncatus  (Fair  et  al.,  2014; 

Schwacke et al., 2014). Joblon et al. (2014) produced a standardised protocol using 

stranded short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), and Clegg et al. (2015) 

developed a standardised BCS graphic for T. truncatus but did not test its reliability. 

The  next  step  for  these  BCS  tools  is  to  correlate  the  results  to  other  measures  of 

affective  state:  Roche  et  al.  (2009)  conducted  this  with  cows,  concluding  that  BCS 

may  serve  as  a  proxy  indicator  for  hunger,  satiety  or  feeling  ill  (leading  to 

inappetence).  Other  health-related  conditions  such  as  diarrhoea,  skin  inflammation, 

eye  condition,  and  coughing,  have  been  used  as  farm  animal  welfare  measures 
(Mononen  et  al.,  2012;  WelfareQuality®,  2009a,b,c),  some  of  which  were  proposed 

for  T.  truncatus  welfare  (skin  and  eye  condition,  coughing;  Clegg  et  al.,  2015),  but 

have not been studied in relation to affective states. Haematological indices can be 

measures  of  disease  states,  especially  when  the  pathology  is  advanced,  but  so  far 

have  had  limited  use  in  welfare  assessments  due  to  potential  high  inter-  and  intra-

individual  variation.  Although  wild  dolphin  health  assessments  have  published  their 

data  and  established  baselines  (Dierauf  and  Gulland,  2001;  Thomson  and  Geraci, 

1986;  Wells,  2009),  and  captive  dolphin  voluntary  blood  sampling  is  readily 

achievable using positive reinforcement training (Brando, 2010), studies have not yet 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						37	

	
linked ranges of blood values to health-related welfare.  

 

Population measures of longer-term health and welfare such as longevity and 

reproductive  rate  should  also  be  considered  (Barber,  2009;  Dawkins,  1998). 

However  as  with  farm  animals,  parameters,  such  as  high  reproductive  success,  do 

not  necessarily  indicate  that  welfare  is  good  (Dawkins,  1980).  For  captive  dolphin 

populations, baselines are being established by projects (notably in the US) allowing 

access  to  their  valuable  multi-species  databases  (Innes  et  al.,  2005;  Small  and 

Demaster,  1995;  Venn-Watson  et  al.,  2011).  Welfare  conclusions  from  fitness 

measures  should  be  supported  by  other  data  (Swaisgood,  2007),  such  as  in 

Christiansen  and  Lusseau’s  study  (2015)  linking  disturbance  behaviour  from  whale-

watching boats, body condition and fetal growth rate in minke whales (Balaenoptera 

acutorostrata). Data on the incidence and severity of diseases can also be used as 

population-level  health  parameters:  such  wild  studies  are  available  (e.g.  Reif  et  al., 

2008;  Schwacke  et  al.,  2014),  but  data  are  not  published  for  captive  dolphins. 

However,  extensive  records  are  kept 

for  most  captive  dolphins  (personal 

communication, C van Elk, September 2016) and thus peer-reviewed publications on 

the nature of their diseases would be beneficial for establishing standardised health 

assessments. 

3.1.3  Physiological parameters 

Measures  of  physiological  responses  can  contribute  to  assessments  of 

emotions  and  affective  states  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007;  Désiré  et  al.,  2002;  Webster, 

2005).  Endocrine  (hormonal)  responses  to  stressors  are  most  commonly  used  (e.g. 

Moberg  and  Mench,  2000),  but  as  interest  increases  in  positive  welfare,  other 

markers  are  being  considered:  for  example  the  balance  of  sympathetic  and 

parasympathetic systems (review by Boissy et al., 2007), and indicators of eustress 

(positive  stressors,  e.g.  mate  acquisition,  experienced  by  the  animal,  Selye,  1975). 

Within  dolphin  physiology  research,  numerous  studies  of  physiological  measures  of 

stress for wild T. truncatus (e.g. Fair et al., 2014; Ortiz and Worthy, 2000; Schwacke 

et  al.,  2014)  have  provided  useful  baselines,  which  will  start  to  elucidate  individual 

variation and repeatability questions (Atkinson et al., 2015). Sample collection in the 

wild  is  challenging  since  taking  blood  is  not  possible  without  restraint  and  faecal 

samples are difficult to obtain (Atkinson et al., 2015). This area specifically is where 

training  for  voluntary  samples  in  captivity  has  exceptional  advantages;  for  example, 

voluntary  saliva  collection 

is 

feasible  and  can  provide  accurate  cortisol 

measurements  in  T.  truncatus  (Pedernera-Romano  et  al.,  2006;  Ugaz  et  al.,  2013). 

Other sampling protocols are also possible with training, such as blood, faecal, blow 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						38	

	
(expiration  of  air)  and  biopsy  collection.  As  for  terrestrial  animals,  marine  mammals 

experience diurnal and seasonal variation in cortisol levels (see Atkinson et al., 2015 

for  review),  which  would  need  to  be  taken  into  account  in  any  welfare  assessment 

and  suggests  that  a  conservative  range  would  need  to  be  used  in  any  conclusions 

made, as opposed to a single threshold. Additionally, a recent review advised caution 

when  applying 

terrestrial  animal  stress  models 

to  marine  mammals.  While 

corticosteroid pathways seem to be similar, evidence indicates other neuroendocrine 

hormones  (e.g.  catecholamines)  may  be  regulated  very  differently  (Atkinson  et  al., 

2015). Further, long-term studies on cetaceans in captivity could start to answer such 

questions  on  hormone  regulatory  systems.  Innovative  new  collection  techniques 

enabling  accurate  animal  identification  (example  with  cetaceans:  whale  blow),  and 

insightful  behavioural  correlations,  must  also  guide  future  progress  (Möstl  and 

Palme, 2002): advice very applicable to dolphin studies. 

3.2  Behaviour 

3.2.1  Social behaviour 

Behavioural  measures  are  an  important  component  in  welfare  frameworks 

(Dawkins,  2004;  Maple,  2007),  with  some  believing  that  they  are  more  informative 

about  welfare  than  health  since  behaviours  are  likely  more  indicative  of  emotional 

state (Gonyou, 1994; Joseph and Antrim, 2010). There have been a number of long-

term  studies  of  wild  dolphin  behaviour  (Mann  et  al.,  2000;  Parsons  et  al.,  2006; 

Wells, 1991), including social relationships within their fission-fusion societies (Mann 

et  al.,  2000;  Wells,  2009).  Surprisingly,  ethological  studies  have  not  been 

commonplace  for  captive  populations  until  recently  (Dudzinski,  2010).  Social 

behaviour measures will foreseeably be one of the most important tools in assessing 

dolphin  welfare:  as  highly  social  mammals  (Mann  et  al.,  2000;  Pryor  and  Norris, 

1998),  they  are  susceptible  to  social  stress.  Sudden  changes  in  conspecific 

associations,  aggression  levels  and  social  isolation  have  been  correlated  with 

declines  in  welfare  (Waples  and  Gales,  2002).  Excessive  or  abnormal  aggression 

levels  are  used  as  farm  animal  welfare  measures  (Mononen  et  al.,  2012;  Webster, 
2005;  WelfareQuality®,  2009b),  and  using  existing  ethograms  of  aggressive 

behaviours  to  analyse  frequencies  over  time  could  reveal  dolphins’  ‘excessive’  and 

‘normal’  thresholds  (Samuels  and  Gifford,  1997;  Scott  et  al.,  2005).  Increased 

quantity  and  severity  of  rake  marks  could  serve  as  a  proxy  indicator  for  levels  of 

aggression and social stress (Scott et al., 2005; Waples and Gales, 2002). Clegg and 

co-authors’  (2015)  rake  mark  assessment,  currently  using  very  conservative 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						39	

	
thresholds,  might  be  validated  to  allow  monitoring  of  aggression  levels.  Rake  mark 

quantification  is  an  example  of  a  method  where  collaboration  between  wild  and 

captive  researchers  might  be  fruitful,  since  aggression  is  harder  to  observe  in  the 

wild  and  rake  mark  levels  could  be  used  as  proxy  measures  (Clegg  et  al.,  2015; 

Scott et al., 2005).  

 

While  social  stress  is  a  negative  consequence  of  being  a  social  mammal, 

there are also positive effects of their highly social life of dolphins. Positive social (i.e. 

affiliative)  behaviour  has  been  proposed  as  an  indicator  of  good  welfare  in  other 

species (Boissy et al., 2007; Buchanan-Smith et al., 2013). Affiliative behaviour has 

been  well-documented  in  wild  Tursiops  spp.  (Connor  et  al.,  2000;  Connor  et  al., 

2006b; Herman and Tavolga, 1980 (early review); Sakai et al., 2006), and a little less 

so  in  captivity  (Dudzinski,  2010;  Tamaki  et  al.,  2006).  Gentle  rubbing  behaviours 

between  dolphins  are  thought  to  be  analogous  to  allogrooming  in  terrestrial 

mammals  (Kuczaj  et  al.,  2013;  Tamaki  et  al.,  2006)  and  may  have  potential  as  a 

measure  of  goof  welfare  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007),  along  with  synchronous  swimming 

(thought to reflect social bonds, Connor et al., 2006b). Dudzinski (2010) and Kuczaj 

et al., (2013) reviewed both wild and captive social affiliative behaviour, agreeing that 

in both settings tactile behaviours seem to be used to express emotions. 

3.2.2  Play 

Play behaviour is one of the strongest potential welfare indicators for animals, 

mainly  because  it  is  more  likely  to  occur  in  the  absence  of  threats  and  utilitarian 

needs (Bel’kovich et al., 1991) and is linked to positive emotions (Held and Špinka, 

(2011) reviewed link with welfare). Play is also likely to improve long-term fitness and 

health, as well as being socially contagious and therefore capable of spreading good 

welfare  in  groups  (Held  and  Špinka,  2011);  these  less-acknowledged  benefits  are 

especially  relevant  to  the  welfare  of  group-living  dolphins.  Despite  this,  play  is  not 
commonly used as a measure in welfare assessments (WelfareQuality® 2009a,b,c), 

most likely because of its inherent variability (Held and Špinka, 2011) and difficulty of 

measurement, as well as evidence in some species that it may not always be linked 

to a positive emotional state (Blois-Heulin et al., 2015).  

 

Evidence  for  wild  and  captive  dolphin  play  is  abundant  (reviews  by:  Kuczaj 

and Eskelinen, 2014; Paulos et al., 2010), including copious examples of object play 

(recent papers: Delfour and Beyer, 2012; Greene et al., 2011; Kuczaj and Makecha, 

2008; Paulos et al., 2010), and evidence of inventing games (Pace, 2000). McCowan 

et al. (2000) showed that captive dolphins monitored their bubble quality as well as 

“plan”  for  the  behaviour:  this  suggests  involvement  of  conscious  thought  and 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						40	

	
appraisal, strengthening the notion that play impacts affective state. Hill and Ramirez 

(2014) studied play in 14 belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) over three years, revealing 

differences  between  adult  and  young  preferences  and  showing  that  bouts  were 

longer  and  more  diverse  when  enrichment  devices  were  involved.  Where  play  is 

studied  in  captivity,  the  influence  of  any  prior  conditioning  should  be  noted:  Neto  et 

al. (2016) showed that when trainers positively reinforced dolphins’ interactions with 

toys,  their  interest  in  the  objects  increased  outside  of  the  sessions.  This  technique 

could be used to increase the benefits of the toys to the dolphins, but until we have 

other measures of positive affective states available in this situation the motivation to 

play may be influenced. In any case, as with all species, standardised measurements 

are needed. A study on African elephants (Loxodonta africana) addressed this using 

a play index (Vicino and Marcacci, 2015), and a similar approach might be possible 

with dolphins. Such a behavioural measure could easily be applicable to wild dolphin 

welfare  assessments,  for  example  to  investigate  whether  exposure  to  more 

environmental or social stressors show reduced play frequencies. 

3.2.3  Abnormal behaviour 

Abnormal  behaviours  are  most  often  studied  in  the  context  of  stereotypic 

behaviour, which has been most recently defined as “…repetitive behaviour induced 

by  frustration,  repeated  attempts  to  cope,  and/or  CNS  dysfunction”  (Mason  and 

Rushen, 2008). Abnormal behaviours are seldom observed in wild animals, although 

Miller  et  al.  (2011a)  suggest  they  observed  stereotypic  swimming  in  lemon  sharks 

(Negaprion brevirostris). In one of the only studies describing abnormal behaviour in 

wild  dolphins,  the  causes  and  effects  of  solitary  living  for  T.  truncatus  were 

investigated,  and  certain  aspects  were  concluded  as  abnormal  (e.g.  behaviour 

oriented  excessively  towards  humans,  Muller  and  Bossley,  2002).  Stereotypic 

behaviour  is  commonly  investigated  as  a  welfare  measure  for  captive  animals 

(review by Mason and Rushen, 2008). There are scarcely any published studies with 

captive  dolphins,  and  the  small  handful  existing  are  out-dated  (Clark,  2013  and 

Gygax,  1993  describe  this  literature),  making  it  hard  to  identify  any  common 

explanatory variables. Stereotypic swimming has been discussed in the literature as 

a  concern  for  captive  dolphins.  There  are  disparities  among  definitions  of  this 

behaviour  (Gygax,  1993;  Miller  et  al.,  2011b),  but  terrestrial  animal  studies  also 

suffered  similar  problems  with  pacing  behaviours  and  found  that  the  variability  and 

possible functions must be meticulously analysed for it to be defined as a stereotypy 

(Rushen  and  Mason,  2008).  Sobel  et  al.  (1994)  observed  preferences  in  the 

directionality of circular swimming, but did not measure whether the route around the 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						41	

	
pool  was  fixed  and  whether  the  animal  was  vigilant  at  the  time.  There  is  little 

evidence correlating stereotypic swimming with other potential factors of welfare: for 

example, although Ugaz et al. (2013) found that in closed facilities there were higher 

rates  of  circular  swimming  as  well  as  higher  cortisol  levels,  they  did  not  statistically 

test  for  a  correlation  between  these  two  factors.  Clegg  et  al.  (2015)  included  a 

stereotypy  measure  but  based  thresholds  on  terrestrial  animal  frequencies,  since 

there  was  no  data  from  dolphin  species.  Since  there  are  on-going  questions  about 

whether higher stereotypy frequency infers poorer welfare even in terrestrial animals 

(Dawkins, 2006; Mason and Latham, 2004; Rushen and Mason, 2008), future studies 

on  this  phenomenon  in  dolphins  should  aim  to  correlate  suspected  stereotypic 

behaviour  with  other  indicators  of  welfare  to  validate  it  as  an  indicator.  Basic  work 

regarding the appearance of stereotypies is also needed, for example the two main 

types of stereotypy defined in terrestrial mammals are ‘oral’ and ‘movement’ (Mason 

and  Rushen,  2008;  Webster,  2005),  so  a  fundamental  investigation  would  be 

whether the same is true for  dolphins.  

3.2.4  Anticipatory behaviour 

Recently, anticipatory behaviour (a measure of “reward-sensitivity”, Spruijt et 

al.,  2001)  has  been  used  as  a  welfare  measure  in  farm  and  zoo  animals;  low 

intensity anticipatory behaviour is thought to reflect positive affective states and high 

intensity anticipation indicates poorer welfare as the animal is heavily dependent on 

the reward (Spruijt et al., 2001; Watters, 2014). While one preliminary study focussed 

on anticipatory behaviour in captive bottlenose dolphins (Jensen et al., 2013), further 

work is necessary given the different training methods (i.e. conditioning to ‘rewards’) 

in dolphin facilities, which might ultimately be closely linked to welfare. Based on the 

reward-sensitivity  paradigm  it  is  likely  that  dolphins  showing  moderate  anticipatory 

behaviour  might  experience  positive  affective  states,  while  those  that  perform  it  for 

excessive  amounts  of  time  might  be  frustrated  or  have  little  other  stimulation 

(Watters, 2014). In order to evaluate its utility for welfare assessment, future studies 

with  dolphins  and  other  species  should  investigate  the  association  between 

anticipatory  behaviour 

frequencies  and  other  welfare 

indicators, 

in  order 

to 

understand what might qualify as ‘excessive’ levels. 

3.3  Cognition

Emotions are defined as intense, short-lived affective responses to an event,

usually associated with specific physiological changes (Danzter, 1988). Animals with 

higher cognitive abilities may be capable of more complex emotions (e.g. guilt) (Paul 

et  al.,  2005),  and  while  this  might  result  in  increased  chances  of  suffering,  it  could 

also lead to higher potential for positive affective states. Research beyond the ‘basic 

emotions’  (e.g.  fear,  rage,  play;  Mendl  et  al.,  2010)  is  essential  to  understand  the 

valence and arousal levels of affective states which make up overall welfare (Leliveld 

et  al.,  2013;  Siegford,  2013).  Boissy  et  al.  (2007)  and  Désiré  et  al.  (2002)  provide 

reviews on measuring animal emotion and the relevance to welfare.  

 

Although  dolphin  emotion  studies  are  scarce,  there  have  been  more  studies 

on  negative  than  positive  ones.  Most  studies  have  looked  at  how  sounds  might 

reflect  emotions,  for  example  burst  pulse  sounds  have  been  associated  with 

agonistic  and  aggressive  behaviours  (Overstrom,  1983),  and  long-term  etho-

acoustical projects have made headway in pairing sounds to behaviour (e.g. Herzing, 

1996;  Janik  and  Sayigh,  2013).  Animal  emotion  research  is  now  widening  to 

measure  positive  emotions  as  well  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007),  but  there  are  no  strongly 

supported  indicators  as  yet  in  dolphins  (Kuczaj  et  al.,  2013).  Tactile  behaviour  was 

suggested  by  Dudzinski  (2010)  and  Kuczaj  et  al.  (2013)  to  be  linked  to  positive 

emotions  in  dolphins,  but  has  not  yet  been  analysed  in  conjunction  with  other 

indicators.  Motivation  and  preference  testing  are  applicable  to  captive  dolphins  and 

could reveal indicators of emotion (Gonyou, 1994; Mendl et al., 2010).  

3.3.2  Environmental enrichment 

This  sub-section 

is  applicable 

to  dolphins  under  human  care  only. 

Environmental  enrichment 

is  any 

technique  designed 

to 

improve  biological 

functioning of captive animals through environmental modification (Newberry, 1995). 

Bottlenose  dolphins  are  good  candidates  for  enhanced  welfare  through  enrichment 

due  to  their  cognitive  abilities  (Schusterman  et  al.,  2013)  and  propensity  to,  and 

creativity within, play (Kuczaj and Eskelinen, 2014). Enrichment has been provided to 

captive dolphins for several decades, but there are few published studies describing 

the  animals’  responses  (for  a  review  see  Clark,  2013).  Furthermore,  providing 

enrichment  is  often  assumed  to  automatically  enhance  welfare  even  if  it  is  unclear 

whether  the  animal’s  affective  state  will  be  improved  (see  reviews  by  Swaisgood, 

2007; Würbel and Garner, 2007). Enrichment should be kept enriching by monitoring 

the  animals’  responses  and  looking  for  signs  of  habituation,  allowing  management 

teams  to  form  a  feedback  loop  which  influences  when,  where  and  how  the 

enrichment is presented again (Hoy et al., 2010; Kuczaj et al., 2002; Siegford, 2013).  

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						43	

Recently,  cognitive  challenges  have  been  presented  as  enrichment,  with 

positive results as long as the animals possess the resources and skills to solve the 

problem (Meehan and Mench, 2007; Siegford, 2013). Clark (2013) supports cognitive 

enrichment  with  dolphin  species,  hypothesising  that  floating,  simplistic  objects  are 

not  sufficient  to  hold  the  dolphins’  interest  in  the  long-term.  However,  behaviour 

should  be  monitored  to  investigate  whether  this  is  indeed  the  case  (Hill  and  Broom 

2009),  and  such  data,  which  shows  responses  to  definable,  repeatable  contexts, 

could  also  aid  in  finding  welfare  indicators  (Delfour  and  Beyer,  2012).  The  Human-

Animal Relationship (HAR) is only just beginning to be investigated in other species 

in  relation  to  cognitive  enrichment  and  welfare  (Whitham  and  Wielebnowski,  2013) 

and,  due  to  the  multiple,  daily,  and  often  close-contact  interactions,  is  very  likely  to 

contribute to the welfare state of captive dolphins (Brando, 2010; Clegg et al., 2015). 

Future investigations assessing the HAR might aim to disentangle the effects of food 

reinforcement  with  the  dolphins’  attitude  towards  the  humans  themselves.  An 

example  of  such  an  approach  is  shown  by  Perelberg  and  Schuster  (2009),  who 

demonstrated  that  outside  of  feeding  sessions,  a  captive  bottlenose  dolphin  group 

approached humans to receive rubs and petting in the absence of any other rewards. 

Given that many cetacean species show much tactile behaviour during intra-specific 

social  affiliation  (Dudzinski,  2010;  Kuczaj  et  al.,  2013),  investigating  the  frequency 

and  dimensions  of  voluntary  human  contact  by  the  animals,  during  and  outside  of 

training sessions, might be a meaningful measure of their affective states. 

3.3.3  Cognitive measures of dolphin welfare 

Dolphins’  cognitive  abilities  are  frequently  compared  to  those  of  great  apes 

(Delfour,  2010;  Schusterman  et  al.,  2013),  and  allow  them  to  thrive  in  their  fusion-

fission  society  (Connor  et  al.,  2000;  Maze-Foley  and  Wursig,  2002),  display 

cooperative hunting (Connor et al., 2000), use tools (e.g. Smolker et al., 1997), and 

recognise  their  mirror  image  (Delfour,  2006;  Reiss  and  Marino,  2001).  Studies  of 

cognitive  bias,  which  investigate  how  emotional  experiences  affect  cognitive 

processes,  may  aid  in  our  interpretation  of  welfare,  and  constitute  measures 

themselves  (Mendl  et  al.,  2009;  Paul  et  al.,  2005).  Given  the  dolphins’  learning 

capabilities  (Brando,  2010),  many  of  the  non-invasive  cognitive  bias  methods 

reviewed  in  Mendl  et  al.,  (2009)  used  with  other  species  could  be  adapted.  Paul  et 

al.,  (2005)  also  reviewed  evidence  for  memory  and  attention  bias  processes  in 

animals,  concluding  that  if  confirmed  they  could  have  implications  for  measuring 

welfare.  

	
 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						44	

In humans as well as non-humans the brain hemispheres process information 

differently,  producing  lateralised  behaviours,  i.e.  a  preference  for  either  the  left  or 

right eye or body part (Rogers, 2002). It seems that animals may predominantly use 

the right hemisphere when stressed (see Rogers, 2010), with Leliveld et al.’s (2013) 

review  going  further  to  conclude  that  negative  emotions  are  managed  by  the  right 

hemisphere and positive emotions by the left (“emotional lateralisation”). Examples of 

lateralised  behaviours  in  wild  and  captive  cetaceans  are  common  e.g.  during 

foraging (Clapham et al., 1995; Silber and Fertl, 1995), flipper-rubbing (Sakai et al., 

2006),  and  visual  discrimination  tasks  (Delfour  and  Marten,  2006;  Yaman  et  al., 

2003).  Most  notably,  Karenina  et  al.  (2010,  2013)  showed  that  belugas  and  killer 

whales (Orcinus orca) placed calves on their right side in non-threatening situations, 

with  killer  whales  preferring  the  left  when  the  situation  became  increasingly 

threatening (in this case proximity to boats). Sakai et al. (2006) suggested a link with 

positive  affective  state  since  the  left  pectoral  fin  and  eye  were  favoured  during 

affiliative  flipper  rubbing  behaviour  in  Indian  Ocean  bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops 

aduncus). These last examples concerning lateralised behaviour and affective states 

should form a basis for future research into welfare implications of this phenomenon.  

 

In the field of cognition in particular, but within health and behaviour as well, 

researchers notably either study wild or captive dolphins but rarely both, resulting in 

a skewed perspective of particular topics in certain environments, and leading us to 

an initial recommendation to increase collaborative efforts and reviews (agreeing with 

Hill  and  Lackups,  2010;  Pack,  2010).  Finally,  although  we  must  understand  the 

dolphins’  cognitive  abilities,  we  should  do  so  bearing  in  mind  their  umwelt,  i.e.  their 

“subjective  universe”,  and  the  focus  of  etho-phenomenological  studies  (Delfour, 

2006,  2010).  For  example,  an  intermodal  associative  task  was  completed  very 

differently by bottlenose dolphin subjects due to the dominance hierarchy at the time 

dictating  participation  and  mode  of  learning  (Delfour  and  Marten,  2006).  Being 

cognisant  of  the  dolphins’  umwelt  may  help  in  determining  what  is  important  to  the 

dolphins, and thus how to provide them with a good quality of life.  

4.  Considerations for Developing Dolphin Welfare Measures 

In this section we review recommendations on design of studies that choose 

to  investigate  the  measures  discussed  above.  Welfare  measures  should  be 

developed  in  situ,  thus  ensuring  applicability  to  the  dolphins  and  their  environment 

(Dawkins, 2006; Maple, 2007). The measures must also be species-specific ( Barber, 

	
 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						45	

	
2009;  Blokhuis,  2008;  Hill  and  Broom,  2009),  examining  welfare  on  an  individual 

level  where  possible  (Siegford,  2013).  Zoological  institutions  have  been  advised  to 

employ  scientists  specifically  dedicated  to  assessing  welfare  (Maple,  2007;  Barber, 

2009), and facilities maintaining dolphins should take this step too.  

 

The  first  proposed  measures  for  T.  truncatus  should  be  validated  through 

correlations with other parameters. Our review pools together potential measures for 

validation:  those  which  we  have  identified  in  cetacean  health,  behaviour  and 

cognition  (Table  1).  Captive  dolphin  research  should  take  the  lead  in  establishing 

welfare  measures  due  to  greater  access  to  the  subjects,  their  history,  and  their 

environment than with wild populations. International, inter-facility collaborations are 

vital  to  combat  problems  of  low  sample  sizes  and  to  control  for  inevitable 

environmental variation. For wild dolphin welfare indicators, long-term studies are the 

natural starting point since most have individual behavioural, physiological, as well as 

life history data (Fair et al., 2014; Wells, 2009). While it would be inaccurate to apply 

all measures for wild and captive animals without validation (Jordan, 2005), it is likely 

that  many  welfare  indicators,  at  least  behaviourally,  will  be  consistent  between  wild 

and captive T. truncatus since their repertoires show similarities (Mann et al., 2000; 

Dudzinski, 2010).

truncatus) where possible, but where these were lacking studies from other cetacean 

species had to be used. 

When validating the first groups of measures, contexts should be used where 

it  is  likely  the  animal  has  very  good  or  poor  welfare  (Castellote  and  Fossa,  2006; 

Jordan, 2005; Whitham and Wielebnowski, 2013). Transportation offers opportunities 

to  assess  welfare  as  it  is  assumed  to  induce  a  substantial,  but  short-term,  welfare 

change  for  captive  cetaceans  (e.g.  Castellote  and  Fossa,  2006).  Long-term  states 

associated  with  social  contexts  may  be  more  salient  for  welfare  measurement:  for 

example the period after transport when the animals are introduced to a new group. 

Group  changes  are  frequent  enough  in  dolphinaria  networks  to  provide  adequate 

sample  sizes  for  analysis.  The  selected  behaviours  and  physiological  parameters 

should  then  be  measured  during  these  events  (and  cognitive  data  if  possible),  with 

focal qualitative data (e.g. trainer ratings) taken concurrently to support the presumed 

change  in  welfare.  Welfare  measures  should  be  conducted  regularly,  and  also 

separately  from  full  assessments.  For  example,  behavioural  measures  of  welfare 

could  be  applied  on  a  weekly  basis  to  dolphin  groups  since  behavioural  monitoring 

has  been  advised  as  essential  for  ensuring  good  welfare  (Maple  2007),  and 

especially  with  captive  dolphins  (Clegg  et  al.,  2015;  Waples  and  Gales,  2002). 

Eventually, comparing results from measures and assessments between individuals 

can highlight associations with good or poor welfare, thus indicating where changes 

in  management  protocols  should  occur  and  stimulating  improvements  in  welfare  of 

the animals themselves. 

5.  Conclusions 

We  have  reviewed  the  literature  on  animal  welfare  science  and  cetology  in 

order to identify the most successful intersections for developing bottlenose dolphin 

welfare  measures.  A  general  theme  is  that  collaborations,  whether  wild-captive, 

across different cetology fields, or between multiple captive facilities, are necessary if 

we want to address this multi-dimensional concept.  

We  suggest  that  indicators  such  as  cortisol  levels,  inappetence  and  bodily 

injuries,  as  well  as  body  condition  and  population  fitness  measures  in  the  longer-

term, may help us assess health-related welfare. Behavioural measures are likely to 

be the most informative for dolphin welfare, and we have shown evidence that tactile 

affiliation,  play,  anticipatory  behaviour  and  stereotypic  behaviours  may  be  closely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						47	

	
linked 

to  affective  states.  Cognitive  measures  reflect  how  behavioural  and 

physiological components are integrated to form the affective states experienced by 

the  animals,  and  thus  recent  techniques  such  as  cognitive  bias  testing  hold  much 

promise for welfare assessment.  

 

Lastly,  we  identified  practical  recommendations  for  validating  the  first 

measures,  concluding  that  although  captive  studies  should  take  the  lead,  long-term 

wild  studies  are  also  rich  sources  of  potential  indicators.  Any  proposed  measures 

should be tested in situations likely to elicit changes in welfare with adequate sample 

sizes  to  allow  the  major  environmental  variations  to  be  controlled  for.  Established 

measures  would  allow  facility  managers  to  monitor  and  improve  the  dolphins’ 

welfare,  aid  in  regulatory  decisions,  and  could  enrich  wild  dolphin  research  by 

revealing  changing  affective  states.  This  review’s  findings  are  species-specific  to 

bottlenose  dolphins,  but  the  general  principles  and  selected  measures  could  be 

adapted to other cetacean species. Our overall aim was to present current cetology 

knowledge  in  terms  of  measuring  welfare,  with  the  hope  of  stimulating  researchers 

globally to take up the challenge.

Thesis ethogram 
 

Following Paper 1, and in preparation for Paper 2 and indeed any other behavioural 

studies  that  were  going  to  be  conducted  during  the  thesis,  a  comprehensive 

ethogram  was  developed  of  bottlenose  dolphin  behaviours.  The  ethogram  was 

constructed using six months of observations at Parc Astérix, Planète Sauvage and 

Dolfinarium Harderwijk (October 2014 – March 2015), and the behavioural definitions 

were  adapted  from  those  found  in  the  literature  (Connor  et  al.,  2006b;  Dudzinski, 

1996; Galhardo et al., 1996; Holobinko and Waring, 2010; Miller et al., 2011b; Sakai 

et al., 2010; Samuels and Gifford 1997; Trone et al., 2005).

Fast swimming  Swimming with vigorous tail beats (c. 3 beats/s), head moves up and 

Locomotor play  Play behaviours involving body movements and manipulation of body parts 

down, eyes open, speed is around 4 m/s 
Dolphin engaged in rubbing, nudging, chasing, attempting to bite, pushing, 
jumping, all more gently and at lower speeds (< 4m/s) than agonistic 
interactions. There are few prolonged instances of aggressive postures 
such as “S” posture (arched back, head and tail lower) or jaw clapping, but 
they may occur very briefly during intense play. 
Play behaviours (e.g. chasing, biting, pushing, jumping) involving a 
toy/bubble/part of the environment, can be solitary or part of a group 

(without object or other dolphin moving them). Usually solitary, but can be 
social if other dolphin imitates or watches closely. Includes carrying (but 
not playing with) the object. 
Dolphin is open-mouthed and trying to bite or chase the tail, and 
sometimes then dorsal and pecs, of another dolphin, who responds 
neutrally i.e. does not respond with play behaviour or aggression; recipient 
dolphin often tries to avoid these threats but is not aggressive at this point 
towards actor. 
Dolphin rubs body or part of body clearly back and forth against another 
object, and not incidentally in an play bout: can be social i.e. with another 
dolphin (even with teeth if very gently and slowly), or solitary i.e. against 
the environment, but is non-sexual (not focussed on genitals, no obvious 
arousal) 
Dolphin moves pectoral fin(s) back and forth to rub the body of another. 
Non-sexual (i.e. not concentrated on genitals). Note who is the actor and 
recipient. 
Dolphin pushes another dolphin (any body part but genitals, otherwise is

pace and very directed, defined as aggressive Body Hit.  

Dolphin swimming within 1 body length of another dolphin, showing 
parallel movements and body axes, with only a few seconds delay at most 
between movements 
Dolphin is swimming while touching another dolphin. To be defined as 
contact the animals must touch/be touching at least every 4-5 seconds. If 
more time elapses, the contact swimming bout is over. The contact could 
be minimal (just pectoral tips, dorsal) or maximal (full belly-melon). 
Dolphin is swimming within touching distance ((less than 0.5m) of another 
animal i.e., if it made a small movement it could conceivably touch its 
partner. 
Dolphin is swimming out of touching distance with another animal but still 
within 1m (therefore distance is between 0.5 - 1m away) 

Dolphin is swimming more than 1m away from the next dolphin but within 1 
body length (further than 1 body length would not be synchronous 
swimming). 
An aggressive behaviour where dolphin bites/rakes or tries to do this to 
another dolphin: may swim along with mouth open 
Dolphin gestures with an open mouth, may open and close rapidly; may 
also be a bubble stream 
Dolphin chases another aggressively at high speed (roughly 4 m/s), may 
see S posture 
Dolphin uses body/body part to hit another dolphin with force 

Dolphin orientates head towards another dolphin obviously while 
swimming next to it, but not touching (note if actor or recipient). Preceding 
or succeeding aggressive behaviour, may be showing S-shape. Not as fast 
as chasing behaviour, and not oriented towards genitals. 
Dolphin engages in genital to genital contact, with or without full 
penetration, with both dolphins’ bodies generally on the same axis i.e. belly 
to belly 
Dolphin positions own body part (e.g. fin, rostrum) in contact with 
conspecific’s genitals, or projects genitals onto other body part of 
conspecific 
Dolphin directs genitals towards genitals of another dolphin, with body axis 
at perpendicular angle to the target dolphin’s body, usually in a forceful 
manner 

swimming next to it, but not touching (note if actor or recipient) 
Dolphin blows a bubble ball or stream (note which) while orientating its 
head and/or body towards another dolphin 
Dolphin positions rostrum against mammary slit of lactating female for >2 
secs  
Dolphin deliberately beaches itself on side of the pool (Note whether other 
dolphins near or not) 
Dolphin purposefully leaps out of water and lands on side, making a loud 
slapping sound. 
Solitary context: dolphin swims parallel (dorsally or ventrally) to surface 
and lifts tail out of water and slaps on surface, making a distinct sound and 
sometimes repeating, and usually near the area where an anticipated 
event will commence. Social context: dolphin uses tail to hit body part of 
another dolphin.

Dolphin propels itself vertically out of the water with the eyes directed to a 
point above the water’s surface, usually as far as the pectoral fins, and 
then descends vertically. Often repeats this several times consecutively. 
While swimming, dolphin propels head and sometimes pectoral fins out of 
the water, to allow a few seconds suspended above the surface where is 
looking at a point above the surface, before a forceful slap is made as its 
head re-enters the water. 
Dolphin lifts head out of the water while on the move, or head is held fixed 
while floating stationary, and eyes are directed towards a point above the 
surface. If a dolphin is swimming at the same time, a surface look can be 
distinguished by the fact the head may be held suspended for a second or 
so above the water, the animal may not necessarily take a breath, and the 
eyes are clearly above the surface line (a distinct “slap” sound is not made 
on re-entering the water).  
Dolphin performs solitary aerial behaviour where body is fully out of the 
water and head and eyes are directed towards the area where the 
anticipated event usually commences.   
Dolphin is solitary and repeatedly performs a behaviour which does not 
vary and appears to have no function. Note the type of stereotypy e.g. 
fence biting (only if invariant), swim patterns (only if using specific part of 
pool in repeated, invariant path), stone chewing 
Dolphin manipulates the throat back and forth swims while in a ventral 
position, with or without snapping mouth open and closed 
Animal repeatedly blows bubbles from blowhole and snaps at them as they 
move past the mouth, always in very similar pool and body positions. Not a 
play behaviour 
Dolphin has head out of water and throws water up in the air and catches 
it. Not conducted in a playful or variable manner, often precedes or follows 
other abnormal repetitive behaviours

manner, more focused, clear objective of the behaviour e.g. chewing

Dolphin focuses eyes and body axis towards environmental stimuli 
underwater, including activity at windows (note if obviously directed at 
observer) 

 
 
* For starred behaviours to be recorded as “anticipatory behaviour” towards 
upcoming training sessions, the dolphin must be focussed on the beach area of the 
pool, with its eyes and normally head orientated towards this area. If play, aggression 
or sexual behaviour is occurring between the focal and other dolphins and the focal 
is not looking at the beach area while performing these behaviours (e.g. leaping), this 
should not be classified as anticipatory behaviour.  
 
†  These behaviours are generally considered as agonistic in nature, and have been

globally, with no variants and using the “synchronous swimming” definition, or a 
higher level of detail can be recorded by using the four definitions of the variants.

Résumé 

Des  modèles  comportementaux  sont  établis  en 

réponse  aux  signaux 

environnementaux  prévisibles.  Tous  les  jours,  les  animaux  en  captivité  vivent 

fréquemment  des  événements  prévisibles  et  contrôlés  par  l’homme,  mais  très  peu 

d'études  se  sont  intéressées  à  comment  leurs  rythmes  comportementaux  sont 

affectés par de telles activités. Les grands dauphins (Tursiops  truncatus) présentés 

au  public  sont  de  bons  modèles  pour  étudier  de  tels  rythmes  puisqu'ils  vivent  de 

nombreuses  périodes  contrôlées  par  l’homme  chaque  jour  (par  exemple  des 

spectacles, des entrainements aux spectacles ou aux soins vétérinaires). Ainsi nous 

avons  examiné 

l'effet  des  horaires  des  sessions  d’entrainement  sur 

leur 

comportement  'de  temps  libre',  en  étudiant  29  individus  dans  quatre  groupes 

hébergés  dans  trois  delphinariums  européens.  Nos  analyses  initiales  du  budget 

temps  ont  révélé  que  parmi  les  comportements  étudiés,  les  dauphins  ont  passé  la 

plupart du temps engagés dans la nage synchronisée, et dans cette catégorie ils ont 

nagé  le  plus  souvent  à  faible  vitesse  et  tout  près  les  uns  des  autres.  La  nage 

synchronisée  ‘lente-proche’  atteignait  un  niveau  maximal  peu  de  temps  après  des 

sessions  d’entrainement  et  était    basse  peu  avant  la  session  suivante.  Le 

comportement  de  jeu  avait  des  fréquences  significativement  plus  hautes  pour  les 

animaux adolescents que pour les adultes, mais l'effet a été seulement vu pendant la 

période  entre  les  sessions  (pas  dans  l'intervalle  un  peu  avant,  ni  un  peu  après  des 

sessions). Le comportement anticipatoire envers les sessions était significativement 

plus  haut  peu  avant  les  sessions  et  plus  bas  ensuite.  Nous  concluons  que  deux 

comportements des dauphins non liés aux périodes contrôlées par l’homme ont été 

tout  de  même  modulés  par  elles  :  la  nage  synchronisée  ‘lente-proche’  et  le  jeu 

(dépendant  de  l’âge),  qui  ont  des  dimensions  sociales  importantes  et  sont  liés  au 

bien-être.  Nous  discutons  des  parallèles  potentiels  relatifs  aux  périodes  contrôlées 

par  l’homme  pour  d'autres  espèces,  y  compris  pour  les  humains  eux-mêmes.  Nos 

découvertes pourraient être prises en compte lors de la conception des évaluations 

de  bien-être  animal  et  elles  pourraient  contribuer  à  gérer 

la  provision 

d'enrichissement et l’efficacité des programmes quotidiens bénéfiques aux animaux 

eux-mêmes.

Abstract 

Behavioral  patterns  are  established  in  response  to  predictable  environmental  cues. 

Animals  under  human  care  frequently  experience  predictable,  human-controlled 

events  each  day,  but  very  few  studies  have  questioned  exactly  how  behavioral 

patterns  are  affected  by  such  activities.  Bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus) 

maintained  for  public  display  are  good  models  to  study  such  patterns  since  they 

experience  multiple  daily  human-controlled  periods  (e.g.  shows,  training  for  shows, 

medical  training).  Thus  we  investigated  the  effect  of  training  session  schedule  on 

their  ‘free-time’  behavior,  studying  29  individuals  within  four  groups  from  three 

European  facilities.  Our  initial  time  budget  analyses  revealed  that  among  the 

behaviors studied, dolphins spent the most time engaged in synchronous swimming, 

and  within  this  category  swam  most  at  slow  speeds  and  in  close  proximity  to  each 

other. ‘Slow-close’ synchronous swimming peaked shortly after training sessions and 

was  low  shortly  before  the  next  session.  Play  behavior  had  significantly  higher 

frequencies  in  juveniles  than  in  adults,  but  the  effect  was  only  seen  during  the  in-

between  session  period  (interval  neither  shortly  before  nor  after  sessions). 

Anticipatory  behavior  towards  sessions  was  significantly  higher  shortly  before 

sessions and lower afterwards. We conclude that dolphin behaviors unconnected to 

the  human-controlled  periods  were  modulated  by  them:  slow-close  synchronous 

swimming  and  age-dependent  play,  which  have  important  social  dimensions  and 

links  to  welfare.  We  discuss  potential  parallels  to  human-controlled  periods  in  other 

species,  including  humans  themselves.  Our  findings  could  be  taken  into  account 

when  designing  welfare  assessments,  and  aid  in  the  provision  of  enrichment  and 

maintaining effective schedules beneficial to animals themselves.

Introduction 

In  humans  and  non-human  animals  the  performance  of  a  behavior  might 

appear  arbitrary  when  viewed  discretely,  but  in  general  repeatable  and  identifiable 

patterns  are  present  across  different  time-scales.  Our  knowledge  of  behavioral 

patterns  in  a  number  of  animal  species  is  well-established  (Finn  et  al.,  2014; 

Mcclintock et al., 2013; Stamps, 2016), with notable developments made in circadian 

and ultradian rhythms (or lack thereof) in general activity and feeding (e.g. Bloch et 

al., 2013; Mistlberger and Skene, 2004; Storch and Weitz, 2009), and aided by new 

technology  (e.g.  accelerometers:  Robert  et  al.,  2009;  Shepard  et  al.,  2008). 

Behavioral patterns in animals or indeed humans are effectuated in response to the 

‘time-structure’  of  the  surrounding  environment  (Daan,  1981),  where  common  and 

predictable salient events entrain the performance of certain behaviors, for example 

food-searching activity in response to the daily appearance of a food source (Storch 

and  Weitz,  2009;  Bloch  et  al.,  2013).  Those  individuals  who  use  the  available 

environmental cues to structure their behavior around the fulfilment of their needs are 

considered  to  be  well-adapted  to  their  surroundings  (McEwen  and  Wingfield,  2003; 

Wingfield, 2005).  

Behaviors  relating  to  food  acquisition  are  among  the  most  fundamental  to 

survival,  and  thus  their  daily  rhythms  and  ‘Zeitgebers’  (entraining  stimuli;  Aschoff, 

1965) have logically been popular research topics for many years. One phenomenon 

under  this  umbrella  is  Food-Anticipatory  Activity  (FAA),  which  describes  animals’ 

increased arousal and locomotory behavior before food events that are available on 

a restricted schedule (Mistlberger, 1994). FAA has been shown to be robust, stable 

over  many  daily  cycles,  and  not  always  within  the  circadian  rhythm  (Storch  and 

Weitz,  2009).  It  has  been  well-studied  in  laboratory  rodents  (see  review  by  Storch 

and Weitz, 2009) and as result progress has been made into the emotional value of 

FAA and other types of anticipatory behavior, where it is thought to be a reflection of 

the  ‘balance  of  reward  systems’  experienced  by  the  animal  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001). 

Animals  in  zoos  and  aquariums  tend  to  have  strongly  structured  daily  schedules  of 

food  provision  and  other  events,  which  are  usually  highly  predictable  through 

numerous  environmental  cues  (Waitt  and  Buchanan-Smith,  2001),  promoting  the 

occurrence  of  anticipatory  behavior  (Watters  2014):  however,  it  has  not  been  well-

studied in this setting (Anderson et al., 2015; Watters, 2014). 

Another element of daily behavioral rhythms that has interested researchers is 

social interaction. Although much less is known about what drives patterns of social 

behavior (Krause et al., 2013), this topic has recently experienced a surge in interest 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						55	

	
(see review by Panksepp et al., 2008). Social behavior can be entrained to circadian 

and  ultradian  rhythms,  and  there  is  also  likely  to  be  a  prominent  genetic  influence 

(Panksepp et al., 2008). Social cues can also be Zeitgebers themselves where they 

stimulate  certain  patterns  of  behaviors  to  occur  (Mistlberger  and  Skene,  2004). 

Human  research  has  shown  that  work  schedules  impact  the  frequency  and  type  of 

social  behavior  conducted  in  after-work  hours  (Ilies  et  al.,  2007;  Sonnentag  and 

Bayer, 2005). Investigating animals’ social behavior patterns is not only desirable for 

its  fundamental  research  value  but  also  in  terms  of  the  many  applications  to 

management practices (Krause et al., 2013; Mistlberger and Skene, 2004).  

Behavioral patterns are more strongly linked to predictable and frequent events 

occurring  in  the  surroundings,  and  for  animals  maintained  under  human  care,  the 

environmental  time-structure  is  largely  dictated  by  human-controlled  events  or 

periods  of  time  (Watters  2014).  However,  there  are  only  a  small  number  of  studies 

focused  on  animal  behavior  in  response  to  human-controlled  schedules  (Waitt  and 

Buchanan-Smith  2001).  Some  animals  are  subject  to  regular,  controlled,  non-

alimentary events, e.g. cows (Bos taurus) being milked (Ketelaar-De Lauwere et al., 

1999), visitors present in proximity to zoo animals (Hosey, 2005), periods of exercise 

and  being  left  alone  for  domestic  pets  (Lund  and  Jørgensen,  1999),  but  nearly  all 

animals are subject to a schedule of food provision by humans. FAA and anticipatory 

behavior  in  response  to  other  events  is  present  and  increasingly  studied  in  captive 

animals, particularly in relation to welfare (Anderson et al., 2015; Jensen et al., 2013; 

Spruijt et al., 2001). Very few studies have looked at the variation of social behavior 

or  general  activity  patterns  in  response  to  different  management  schedules  (Storch 

and  Weitz,  2009).  However,  limited  results  thus  far  indicate  that  as  well  as  food-

related  behavior,  social  and  other  behavioral  activity  unrelated  to  human-controlled 

periods can vary as a result of the time-structure (with primate species: Ulyan et al., 

2006; Waitt and Buchanan-Smith, 2001).  

Bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  under  human  care  are  a  striking 

example of animals that inhabits an environment closely controlled by humans, and 

their  days  are  generally  structured  by  a  number  of  training  sessions.  These  may 

constitute shows, show training, medical training, guest interactions, “play” sessions, 

cognitive  tasks  (all  described  hereafter  as  ‘training  sessions’),  but  all  within  which 

they  receive  their  food  as  reinforcement  after  participating  in  exercises  chosen  by 

their  care-takers  (Brando,  2010).  The  dolphins  and  this  environment  represent  a 

good model for the study of behavioral patterns since they experience repeated and 

controlled daily events, are easily observable, and are gregarious animals, therefore 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						56	

	
providing  the  opportunity  to  analyze  the  impact  on  social  behaviors  as  well.  Only  a 

few studies have focused on behavioral patterns in captive dolphins (Galhardo et al., 

1996;  Nelson  and  Lien,  1994;  Saayman  et  al.,  1973;  Sekiguchi  and  Kohshima, 

2003), and thus even fewer look at the effect of training sessions. One study found 

that  as  the  latency  to  and  from  sessions  varied,  the  occurrence  of  dolphins’ 

behaviors within affiliative, aggressive and repetitive categories also varied, although 

the  authors  concluded  they  were  likely  not  caused  by  the  sessions  since  notable 

individual  behavioral  differences  were  observed  (Miller  et  al.,  2011b).  In  addition, 

anticipatory behaviors were not investigated and one category was used for all social 

interactions.  In  a  study  on  three  Indo-Pacific  humpback  dolphins  (Sousa  chinensis) 

individual  differences  in  behavior  were  found  before  and  after  guest  interactions 

(Sew  and  Todd,  2013),  and  thus  collective  findings  were  limited.  Recently,  it  was 

shown  that  bottlenose  dolphins  significantly  increased  the  frequency  of  anticipatory 

behavior  in  relation  to  upcoming  training  sessions  (Jensen  et  al.,  2013).  Thus  far 

there  have  been  no  findings  showing  how  the  daily  behavioral  pattern  of  captive 

dolphins might be structured around the multiple, human-controlled training sessions.  

The  aim  of  our  study  was  to  investigate  how  scheduled  human-controlled 

activities  modulate  animals’  behavior  in  their  ‘free-time’,  through  observations  of 

multiple  groups  of  bottlenose  dolphins  in  different  facilities.  Our  focus  was  on 

behaviors  related  to  the  sessions  (i.e.  anticipatory)  and  social  behaviors.  Zoo  and 

aquarium  environments  promote  the  development  of  anticipatory  behavior  and 

evidence already supports its presence in bottlenose dolphins (Jensen et al., 2013). 

We  predicted  that  our  defined  anticipatory  behaviors  would  increase  in  the  period 

before the next scheduled session. In a previous similar study, data on synchronous 

swimming  was  not  taken  (Miller  et  al.,  2011b),  and  in  another  it  was  chosen  to 

consider any type of swimming as the ‘default’ behavior (Sew and Todd, 2013). As a 

consequence, a concurrent aim of our study was to investigate, in much more detail 

than  previously,  the  dolphins’  behavior  of  swimming  synchronously.  Other  salient 

social  behavior  categories  (play,  aggression,  and  sexually  motivated)  were  chosen 

as  the  most  often  seen  in  dolphin  interactions  (Galhardo  et  al.,  1996;  Samuels  and 

Gifford,  1997;  Shane  et  al.,  1986).  Due  to  the  lack  of  previous  studies  a  priori 

predictions  were  not  possible,  but  we  expected  that  at  least  some  social  behaviors 

would vary in relation to the session schedule.  

Since  daily,  human-controlled  periods  are  a  common  phenomenon  for  many 

captive  animals,  the  results  of  our  study  could  extend  to  forming  cross-species 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						57	

	
parallels, including behavior of working animals and even regarding the daily routines 

of humans. 

 

Materials And Methods 

Study Animals and Facilities 

 

Our  study  included  29  Atlantic  bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus) 

housed at three European zoological facilities and maintained in 4 groups, all kept in 

artificial  pool  complexes.  There  were  eight  dolphins  at  Parc  Astérix  (Plailly,  France) 
living in an outdoor pool conjoined to two indoor pools with a total volume of 3790 m3 

of water, where there was always free access to all pools (see Table 2 for age and 

sex  characteristics  of  the  study  population).  At  Planète  Sauvage  (Port-Saint-Père, 

France),  7  dolphins  inhabited  four  inter-connected  pools  which  together  contained 
7490  m3  of  water.  In  general  the  gates  to  all  pools  were  left  open  but  sometimes 

access was prevented to pools for maintenance. At the start of the study there were 

six  dolphins  in  this  group  but  after  two  weeks  a  25-year-old  female  arrived:  on  her 

first night she stayed in the medical pool with one other male before being mixed with 

the  group  the  next  day.  Dolfinarium  Harderwijk  (Harderwijk,  The  Netherlands) 

housed 14 dolphins in a network of seven pools interconnected by gates and sluice 
channels,  with  a  total  volume  of  2743  m3.  The  animals  at  this  facility  were  split  into 

groups  of  six  and  eight  animals,  where  the  group  of  eight  participated  in  the  shows 

while  the  other  six  dolphins  primarily  conducted  guest  interactions.  Of  the  29 

dolphins  in  the  study  population,  25  were  captive-born  and  4  originally  wild  caught. 

Planète  Sauvage  and  Dolfinarium  Harderwijk  were  open  daily  to  the  public  for  the 

whole of the study period, and Parc Astérix opened two weeks into data collection. At 

all parks, the dolphins’ diets consisted of a variety of fish and squid species being fed 

to  them  at  multiple  sessions  during  the  day,  with  the  total  amount  per  day  for  each 

dolphin  ranging  between  5  and  12  kg.  Also  in  all  parks,  during  the  day  there  were 

generally three public presentations (a type of training session but with an audience 

present)  and  between  two  and  five  other  training  sessions  (which  could  include 

training  for  shows,  medical  training,  play  sessions  and  research  sessions),  and 

always having two short feeding-only sessions at the beginning and end of the day. 

All these types of sessions were considered under the umbrella of ‘training session’ 

for our methods and analysis, but the potential variance was addressed by testing for 

effects of type and duration of sessions in our analyses.

Data Collection  

Study period 

The  study  took  place  at  all  three  parks  from  April  to  June  2015,  and 

observations were taken at random times of the day between 07:00 and 21:00.  

Behavioral observations 

We  established  a  five-minute  focal  observation  protocol  with  scan  sampling 

every  15s  where  the  behavior  being  performed  was  noted  down  (Martin  and 

Bateson,  1986).  Scans  where  the  animal  was  not  visible  were  recorded  so  that  a 

percentage of total scans (maximum of 21 scans) could be calculated.  

At Parc Astérix, the positioning of underwater windows allowed observations 

to always be conducted from this location since a large proportion of the pool could 

be  seen  at  all  times,  whereas  at  Planète  Sauvage  and  Dolfinarium  Harderwijk  the 

view  from  underwater  windows  covered  50%  of  the  pool  or  less,  so  observations 

were  conducted  above  water.  Both  observation  positions  were  adopted  since  the 

pools’  water  was  always  clear,  the  background  color  contrasted  well  with  the 

dolphins’  bodies,  and  the  behaviors  were  clearly  recognizable  above  and  below 

water. Above and below-water observer positions were at inconspicuous locations to 

limit the effects on the dolphins’ behavior. 

We  developed  a  behavioral  repertoire  containing  22  behaviors  within  five 

categories  (synchronous  swimming;  play;  overt  aggressive:  sexually  motivated; 

anticipatory)  (Thesis  ethogram,  Chapter  2),  with  the  aim  of  including  the  most 

1

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						59	

	
common anticipatory and social behaviors for this species. The behaviors were taken 

directly  or  adapted  from  published  repertoires  (Clegg  et  al.,  2015;  Galhardo  et  al., 

1996;  Holobinko  and  Waring,  2010;  Samuels  and  Gifford,  1997).  In  regard  to 

measuring synchronous swimming behavior, Connor and co-authors (2006b) used a 

differentiation of distance between partners, but here we went a step further and also 

took into account the speed of the behavior, since it is likely synchronous swimming 

at  different  speeds  has  different  functions  (e.g.  faster  in  aggressive  contexts; 

Herzing,  1996).  Therefore,  we  defined  synchronous  swimming  by  proximity  and 

speed  (slow:  around  2  m/s  or  less,  minimal  tail  beats;  fast:  more  than  2m/s  and 

stronger  tail  beats  which  may  cause  head  to  move  up  and  down;  close:  contact  to 

partner  or  within  touching  distance  [≤  0.5  m];  distant:  partner  is  0.5  m  –  one  body 

length away) in order to investigate the variation in each sub-category’s occurrence. 

This yielded four categories of the behavior: slow-close, slow-distant, fast-close and 

fast-distant synchronous swimming.  

Individual recognition of study animals 

No individual tagging or marking was used. Each dolphin could be recognized 

individually by a combination of: distinct patterns of notches on the dorsal fin and tail, 

patches  of  permanent  skin  discoloration  on  the  body,  size  and  shape  of  the  eyes, 

and  general  coloration  of  the  body.  It  was  verified  that  each  observer  could  identify 

the dolphins with 100% accuracy, multiple times each, before data collection began. 

Observers and inter-observer concordance  

There  were  three  different  observers  at  each  park  (IM,  MC  and  DV),  who 

were all trained by the same person (IC) to use the same data collection techniques 

and accompanying behavioral repertoire. Prior to the start of data collection an inter-

observer  reliability  test  was  conducted  using  five  randomly  chosen  video  footage 

samples  of  5  minutes  each  stemming  from  different  animals.  An  intra-class 

correlation  based  on  1,000  permutations  (library  rptR;  Schielzeth  and  Nakagawa, 

2013)  revealed  a  very  high  concordance  in  the  time  budgets  of  the  different 

behaviors  quantified  by  the  3  observers  with  respect  to  slow-close  (R  =  0.999,  P  < 

0.001),  slow-distant  (R  =  0.992,  P  <  0.001),  fast-close  (R  =  0.999,  P  =  0.013)  and 

fast-distant synchronous swimming (R = 0.999, P = 0.012), and also with respect to 

sexually  motivated  behavior  (R  =  0.833,  P  =  0.012)  and  anticipatory  behavior  (R  = 

0.904, P < .001). Play behavior and aggression in these videos was quantified by all 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						60	

	
observers to be zero, and thus the inter-observer agreement was 100% with respect 

to these behaviours (not tested statistically).  

Timing of training 

No observations were taken during the training sessions, and the time delay 

since the last session and until the next one was recorded by the observer for each 

observation.  Subsequently  we  defined  the  timing  of  training  variable  into  three 

periods:  “shortly  before”:  ≤  15  min  before  the  next  session  (n  =  145  observations); 

“shortly  after”:  ≥  15  min  after  the  last  session  (n  =  157  observations);  and  “In-

between”:  the  intermediate  period  more  than  15  min  since  the  last  and  before  the 

next  session  (n  =  724  observations).  It  was  verified  that  the  data  included  only 

observations done when training sessions were at least 30 minutes apart to ensure 

these categories were mutually exclusive.  

Ethics Note 

Behavioral  observation  was  the  only  means  of  data  collection  for  this  study 

and  the  ASAB/ABS  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of  Animals  in  Research  (2012)  were 

consulted and followed. As a result of this study all routines remained unchanged for 

the  animals  and  the  only  difference  to  their  environment  was  an  observer  standing 

either by the poolside or at the underwater window for a maximum of two hours per 

day. This study, which was purely observational, was reviewed and accepted by the 

pluridisciplinary scientific committee of the company representing the facilities. 

Data Analysis and Sample Size 

Statistical  analyses  were  done  with  R,  version  3.1.1  (R  Core  Team,  2016). 

We  applied  generalized  linear  mixed-effects  models  GLMM  for  proportional  data, 

using  a  model  structure  for  binomial  distribution  with  a  logit  link.  Calculations  were 

based on Laplacian maximum likelihood estimates using the package lme4 (Bates et 

al., 2015). P-values were calculated by likelihood ratio tests based on the changes in 

deviance  when  a  factor  was  removed  from  the  full  main  effects  model,  or  an 

interaction was added to it (Faraway, 2006). 

A total of 1026 five-minute observations from 29 different animals (6 juvenile 

males  and  16  adult  males;  1  juvenile  female  and  6  adult  females)  from  3  different 

facilities and kept in 4 different groups were available for this study (details on study 

animals in Table 2). The age class of juveniles included all animals younger than 10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						61	

	
years;  older  animals  were  considered  as  adults  (Smolker  et  al.,  1992).  All  juveniles 

had  stopped  nursing  at  the  time  of  the  study.  Data  were  expressed  as  percentage 

(for analysis: proportion) of scans (per total visible scans) of the different behaviors, 

used as dependent variables in our models. Independent variables were the animals’ 

age  class,  sex  (factors  with  2  levels),  and  the  timing  of  training  (factor  with  three 

levels), see above for a definition of levels. Due to notable collinearities between sex 

and  age  class,  these  two  factors  were  never  tested  within  the  same  model.  We 

considered  2-way  interactions  between  sex  or  age  class  and  the  timing  of  training. 

See Fig. 1 for sample sizes within the different levels of the factors.  

Models included individual identity as a random factor to account for repeated 

measurements from the different animals. Overall, we obtained 11 to 57, on average 

35,  5-min  observations  per  dolphin.  In  addition,  we  included  group  identity  as  a 

random  factor  to  account  for  the  different  origin  of  the  animals  and  for  the 

dependencies  in  behavior  within  groups.  We  also  considered  the  identity  of  the 

facility  as  an  additional  random  factor  which,  however,  did  not  account  for  any 

additional variation, as it was strongly collinear with the identity of the groups. Thus, 

this  random  factor  was  omitted  from  the  model  and  these  were  re-calculated.  This 

procedure  did  not  change  any  of  the  results  obtained.  The  content  of  training 

sessions  could  vary  between 

free-feeds 

(no  behaviors  asked, 

fish  given 

consecutively until ration is finished), training (rehearsal of known or teaching of new 

behaviors, husbandry tasks, play or fun sessions) or show/guest interactions (either 

a show with public present or an interaction session with guests, who remain out of 

water).  As  the  type  of  the  prior  as  well  as  the  upcoming  session  might  have 

potentially  and  differentially  influenced  the  behavior  of  the  animals,  we  included 

“session type” as an additional random factor. 

Models  were  checked  for  homogeneity  of  variances  and  goodness  of  fit  by 

plotting  residuals  versus  fitted  values.  As  models  showed  signs  of  over-dispersion, 

we  included  a  case-level  random  factor  (Browne  et  al.,  2005).  Furthermore,  we 

calculated  variance 

inflation  coefficients  (VIF) 

for  all  models  with  multiple 

independent variables (sex and timing of training, or age class and timing of training) 

to  check  for  (multi)collinearities  among  them  (Zuur  et  al.,  2010).  VIF  were  always 

lower than 2, indicating no interfering effects of multicollinearities.

Results 

Time Budgets of Different Behaviors 

 

The different behaviors observed differed significantly in their occurrence (

4χ
=  11951.03,  P  <  0.001).  The  behavior  which  was  the  most  frequent  i.e.  in  terms  of 

2

percentage of scans out of total visible scans per observation (hereafter described as 

frequency)  was  synchronous  swimming,  displayed  for  an  average  of  35.2%  (CI95%: 

33.0%, 37.4%) of scans per observation (Fig. 4a).  

Synchronous  swimming  was  categorized  into  slow-close,  slow-distant,  fast-

close and fast-distant. These categories also differed significantly in their occurrence 

2

(

3χ  =  115.05,  P  <  0.001)  with  slow-close  synchronous  swimming  displayed  most 

often  at  an  average  of  22%  of  scans  per  observation,  followed  by  slow-distant  at 

14%,  then  fast-distant  at  6%,  with  fast-close  swimming  occurring  in  only  1%  of 

observation scans (Fig. 4b). 

Effects of Different Factors on Behavior 

 

Slow-close  synchronous  swimming  differed  significantly  with  respect  to  the 

timing  of  training  (Table  3a).  Animals  showed  significantly  lower  frequencies  of  this 

behavior  15  minutes  before  and  the  highest  occurrences  15  minutes  after  the 

training. During the time in-between, i.e. between the periods shortly after and shortly 

before  the  training,  this  behavior  was  seen  at  intermediate  levels  (post-hoc 

comparisons in Fig. 5a). 

Slow-distant  synchronous  swimming  did  not  significantly  differ  between  the 

three time periods considered, although the frequencies were significantly higher by 

2.0% in males than in females (Table 3b). There were no significant effects of any of 

the  factors  considered  on  the  frequencies  of  fast-close  and  fast-distant  swimming 

(Table 3c,d). 

The  frequency  of  play  behavior  depended  on  the  timing  of  training  session; 

however, this effect was modulated by the animals’ age (see significant interaction in 

Table 3e). Juveniles showed significantly more play behavior than adults in-between 

the  training  sessions,  which  was  on  average  2.7  times  that  of  adults.  However, 

differences  were  not  statistically  significant  during  other  time  periods  (post-hoc 

comparisons in Fig. 5b).

repeated 5-min daylight observations, showing average percentage of scans per 5 

min observation spent on (a) the five behavioral categories studied (definitions in 

Thesis ethogram, Chapter 2) and (b) the four variants of synchronous swimming. 

Percentage scans denotes the scans where a certain behavior was performed out of 

the total visible scans in the focal 5 min observation. Data are based on 1026 

observations from 29 dolphins kept in 4 different groups. Different letters indicate 

significant differences between groups, tested by pair-wise comparisons using 

GLMM for proportional data with sequential Bonferroni correction (Holm, 1979). 

Anticipatory  behavior  was  seen  significantly  higher  by  on  average  5.8%  of 

scans  per  observation  shortly  before  the  training  sessions  when  compared  to  the 

period shortly after and in-between (Table 3h; post-hoc comparisons in Fig. 5c). 

There  were  no  significant  effects  of  any  of  the  factors  tested  on  the 

frequencies  of  overt  aggressive  or  sexually  motivated  behavior  (Table  3f  and  3g). 

Additionally,  none  of  the  factors  or  interactions  considered  were  significant  when 

separately  analyzing  offensive  and  defensive  overt  aggression,  or  acting  and 

receiving sexually motivated behaviors (all P > 0.10).

Fig. 5 (a) Effects of the timing of training sessions on the percentage of scans per 

observation of slow-close synchronous swimming, (c) anticipatory behavior, and (b) 

play behavior where differences were seen between juveniles and adults during the 

different time periods (significant interaction, see Table 3). Percentage scans 

denotes the scans where a certain behavior was performed out of the total visible 

scans in the focal 5 min observation. Sample sizes (total number of observations per 

group) are given in the bars; see Table 3 for details on statistics. Different letters 

indicate significant differences between groups, tested by pair-wise comparisons 

using GLMM for proportional data with sequential Bonferroni correction (Holm, 1979). 

Discussion 

Overall,  we  found  that  the  schedule  of  sessions  significantly  modulated 

behaviors in the three most commonly shown behavioral categories that we studied: 

synchronous  swimming,  play  and  anticipatory  behavior.  Our  results  showed  a  peak 

in  slow-close  synchronous  swimming  after  sessions,  higher  frequencies  of  age-

dependent  play  in  the  in-between  session  period,  and  high  levels  of  anticipatory 

behavior shortly before training sessions.  

Veasey (2006) emphasized how evaluating time budgets of captive animals is 

fundamental 

for 

investigations  on  how  behavioral  patterns  are  affected  by 

management protocols. We used the percentage of scans out of the total visible in 5 

min  focal  observations  to  formulate  a  type  of  time  budget,  which  showed  that 

synchronous  swimming  was  by  far  the  most  frequent  behavior  seen,  with  play  and 

anticipatory behavior the next most common but relatively at lower levels. This study

is  the  first  to  separate  synchronous  swimming  by  speed  as  well  as  by  distance  to 

partner  (Connor  et  al.,  2006b  defined  distances),  and  the  different  rates  of 

occurrence  indicate  that  each  swimming  topography  may  have  a  different  role  in 

social interactions of dolphins.  

Behaviors Modulated by Schedule of Sessions 

The  frequencies  of  slow-close  synchronous  swimming,  play  and  anticipatory 

behavior observed in our study were influenced by the timing of sessions. In dolphin 

species, synchronous swimming has often been suggested as an affiliative behavior 

which helps to maintain bonds, and is thought to be an indicator of positive emotions 

(Connor  et  al.,  2006b;  Holobinko  and  Waring,  2010).  Since  the  proximity  between 

partners  is  likely  to  be  salient  in  relation  to  the  different  functions  of  synchronous 

swimming  (Connor  et  al.,  2006b),  we  chose  to  study  four  variants  of  this  behavior 

and  found  that  only  slow-close  swimming  was  modulated  with  timing  to  or  from 

sessions. Synchronous swimming in close proximity starts at birth and although the 

spatial  arrangements  of  the  partners  develops  with  age  (among  other  factors),  it  is 

thought  that  dolphins  swimming  closer  together  have  a  stronger  relationship 

(Gubbins  et  al.,  1999;  Holobinko  and  Waring,  2010).  Therefore  our  results  of  slow-

close synchronous swimming is likely to reflect the formation and/or maintenance of 

social bonds in the group, and may be seen more frequently following the sessions 

since  the  dolphins  are  reunited  after  a  human-controlled  period  of  separation.  A 

recent  study  at  Parc  Astérix  showed  that  the  emission  rate  of  signature  whistles 

increased after the training sessions, and the authors postulated that they function as 

cohesion calls and affiliative signals: this concurs strongly with the behavioral results 

in  our  study  (Lopez  Marulanda  et  al.,  2016).  Examples  can  also  be  found  in  other 

species:  working  donkeys  (Equus  africanus  asinus)  gathered  together  to  socially 

interact  immediately  after  finishing  their  working  period,  even  if  they  were  fatigued 

and dehydrated, and water and food were available (Swann, 2006). Our results with 

the dolphins’ slow-close synchronous swimming concur with the increase in general 

affiliative behaviors seen after sessions by Miller and colleagues (2011b). However, 

the  component  of  synchronicity  of  this  behavior  may  have  a  stronger  significance 

than  other  affiliative  behaviors:  a  recent  review  concludes  that  activity  synchrony  in 

animals,  where  behaviors  are  performed  in  unison,  is  itself  likely  to  represent  close 

social bonds between individuals (Duranton and Gaunet, 2016). A recent study found 

links  between  the  level  of  synchrony  during  food  provision  and  milking  of  cows,  to 

their lying and grazing behavior in their free time (Flury and Gygax, 2016): a similar 

 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						67	

	
investigation  with  dolphins’  synchrony  during  and  outside  of  training  sessions  might 

shed further light on this element of their behavior patterns. 

 

An alternative explanation to increased synchronous swimming after sessions 

might be that it functions as a rest or sleep period. The training sessions are a form 

of  exercise  (Brando,  2010),  and  it  is  thought  that  dolphins  need  to  sleep  from  4-6 

hours per day (range taken from wild and captive research: Goley, 1999; Lilly, 1964; 

Lyamin  et  al.,  2008).  Their  decision  to  conduct  sleep  behavior  synchronously  with 

others  could  be  an  adaptive  strategy  to  improve  vigilance  (Goley,  1999).  However, 

dolphins  perform  slow-wave  unihemispheric  sleep  and  thus  often  do  not  close  both 

eyes, 

rendering 

their  sleep  behavior 

“indistinguishable 

from 

that  of  quiet 

wakefulness”  (Oleksenko  et  al.,  1992).  Therefore  from  our  results  we  cannot 

conclude for certain whether this might have been the true function of the behavior; 

this might be clarified in further studies.  

 

Play  is  usually  considered  an  affiliative  behavior  (Bateson,  2014;  Boissy  et 

al.,  2007;  in  dolphins:  Kuczaj  and  Eskelinen,  2014;  Neto  et  al.,  2016;  Paulos  et  al., 

2010; but see Blois-Heulin et al., 2015; Hausberger et al., 2012) and was performed 

in  our  study  at  higher  frequencies  in  the  in-between  session  period,  but  only  in 

juveniles. On average there were indications of a similar tendency for shortly before 

the  sessions  as  well,  but  this  effect  was  not  significant,  perhaps  due  to  our  smaller 

sample  size  of  juvenile  dolphins.  There  is  evidence  that  aerial  behaviors,  a  likely 

component of play, occur more frequently in wild and captive dolphins after a feeding 

event  (Paulos  et  al.,  2007),  and  it  is  well-accepted  that  play  occurs  mostly  when 

other  needs,  such  as  food  acquisition,  are  satisfied  (Baldwin  and  Baldwin,  1976; 

Bateson,  2014;  Boissy  et  al.,  2007).  However  while  evidence  supporting  this  is 

available  for  juveniles  in  many  species,  the  association  between  adult  play  and 

affective  state  remains  unclear  (Blois-Heulin  et  al.,  2015).  Our  results  suggest  that 

juveniles may be more sensitive to the environmental time-structure, leading them to 

play  mostly  in  the  times  farthest  from  the  sessions.  Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  as 

play  is  often  considered  an  indicator  of  positive  emotions  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007;  Held 

and Špinka, 2011), it could be hypothesized that the juveniles either experience more 

positive affective states and/or are more aroused/excited in-between the sessions as 

compared  to  adults.  Further  work  on  the  daily  patterns  of  dolphin  play  with  large 

sample sizes are needed to fully understand this age-dependent element. 

The  higher  occurrence  of  anticipatory  behaviors  observed  shortly  before 

sessions was the result we most expected to see; a recent first study with bottlenose 

dolphins  found  similar  results  (Jensen  et  al.,  2013)  and  there  is  much  anecdotal 

 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						68	

	
evidence from the animals’ care-takers. It was no surprise that dolphins can predict 

imminent  start  of  training  sessions,  especially  since  the  timings  were  fairly  regular 

and environmental cues were available (e.g. sound of buckets) in the three parks in 

our  study.  Anticipatory  behavior  reflects  the  ability  of  animals  to  respond  to 

predictable daily events, but it has also recently been proposed as an indicator of the 

balance  of  reward  systems  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001).  A  certain  level  of  anticipatory 

behavior  is  thought  to  reflects  positive  expectation  of  the  event,  but  excessive 

anticipation,  either  in  terms  of  duration  or  intensity,  may  reflect  negative  affective 

states such as frustration, perhaps due to lack of other stimulation in the environment 

(Spruijt  et  al.,  2001;  Watters  2014).  Our  study  provides  preliminary  results 

concerning this behavior in dolphins which could then be developed upon in order to 

investigate certain frequencies relevant to the balance of reward systems. 

 

Our  results  show 

that 

three  different  dolphin  behaviors  occurred  at 

predictable  points  in  relation  to  the  session  schedule,  and  that  this  was  not 

significantly  influenced  by  individual  or  facility  differences.  Thus  we  might  say  that 

these behaviors are entrained in an ultradian rhythm (recurrent cycle repeated within 

24  hours)  by  the  timings  of  the  training  sessions.  Feeding  times  and  rest-activity 

cycles have been shown to act as Zeitgebers as well as light and dark phases (Flury 

and Gygax, 2016). However, we can only postulate this for our study population due 

to  some  limitations  which  must  be  discussed.  Firstly,  much  further  work  would  be 

needed to understand whether it is the food provision or exercise/cognitive element 

that entrains the rhythm, how easy it is to disrupt, and whether in fact it is social cues 

that  prompt  the  group  to  perform  a  certain  behavior  in  synchrony.  Bloch  and 

colleagues  (2013)  recently  postulated  that  highly  social  animals,  and  those  in  a 

constant environment, are more likely to have ultradian behavioral patterns. Further 

studies  are  needed  before  this  can  be  confirmed  for  dolphins,  where  the  timings  of 

sessions, environmental cues, and light and dark cycles would need to be controlled 

for as was not possible in our study.  

 

  

Relevance to Dolphin Welfare and Implications for Other Species 

  Overall,  our  results  contribute  to  improving  our  knowledge  of  how  the 

dolphins respond to the captive environment, since an individual’s behavioral pattern 

is  a  fundamental  indicator  of  how  it  is  adapting  to  its  environment  (Eagle  and 

Pentland,  2009;  McEwen  and  Wingfield,  2003;  Wingfield,  2005),  and  thus  is  highly 

relevant to evaluating overall welfare (Broom, 1991; Dawkins, 1998; Veasey, 2006). 

The relatively large sample size of dolphins and observations allowed us to see past 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						69	

	
short-term individual behavioral differences, which limited conclusions in the previous 

studies on this topic (Miller et al., 2011b; Sew and Todd, 2013; Trone et al., 2005). 

Although  not  the  objective  of  our  study,  some  possible  implications  for  dolphin 

welfare and its assessment can be seen in the results.  

 

Firstly,  those  designing  welfare  assessments  should  take  into  account  daily 

rhythms of behaviors and their likely cues. Here, the dolphin behaviors modulated by 

the  schedule  of  training  sessions  had  all  previously  been  suggested  as  emotion  or 

welfare indicators (Connor et al., 2006b; Holobinko and Waring, 2010; Jensen et al., 

2013;  Neto  et  al.,  2016),  and  thus  in  the  future  might  be  measured  as  part  of  a 

comprehensive  assessment.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  timing  of  human-controlled 

periods must be taken into account when quantifying such behaviors in dolphins, or 

indeed  other  species:  the  time  when  a  certain  welfare  measure  is  conducted  in 

relation to these periods might affect the data collected and conclusions made (e.g. 

frequency of play behavior).   

 

Our  findings  also  allow  us  to  suggest  some  more  specific  implications  for 

dolphin  welfare.  The  performance  of  synchronous  swimming  peaked  shortly  after 

training  sessions  and  thus  in  order  not  to  disturb  this  behavior  pattern,  it  could  be 

beneficial  for  the  management  team  to  not  provide  environmental  enrichment 

immediately following sessions (as some facilities do) but instead after a short delay. 

In general, affiliative behaviors (such as synchronous swimming for the dolphins) and 

juvenile  play  in  animals  are  thought  to  be  naturally  rewarding  and  induce  positive 

affect in animals (Bateson, 2014; Boissy et al., 2007). Indicators of affective state in 

dolphin species are highly sought after (Clegg et al., 2015) and we show here that, 

as  well  as  play  behavior,  synchronous  swimming  when  delineated  by  speed  and 

proximity represents a strong potential indicator and deserves further research in this 

context.  

 

We provide definitions of multiple anticipatory behaviors in dolphins (validated 

by  the  significant  increase  in  this  activity  shortly  before  sessions),  and  the  fact  that 

this  was  a  concurrent  finding  despite  facility  and  management  differences,  for  on 

average 6% of observation time, could provide a starting point for further work on this 

phenomenon which is thought to indicate welfare state (Spruijt et al., 2001, Watters, 

2014). The next step would be to test different frequencies of anticipatory behavior in 

conjunction  with  other  physiological  and  cognitive  data  (Anderson  et  al.,  2015)  to 

investigate  whether,  and  to  what  extent,  it  represents  either  positive  affect  in  the 

dolphins  as  they  await  their  ‘reward’  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001),  or  whether  in  some 

	

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						70	

	
contexts this activity can induce negative emotions such as frustration (Boissy et al., 

2007).  

 

There are many other animal species that experience daily human-controlled 

sessions. Our results correlate to other similar studies: Baldwin and Baldwin (1976) 

found that feeding ecology and play behavior were closely linked in squirrel monkeys 

(Simia  sciureus)  since  even  changing  the  form  of  the  food  given  decreased  play 

behavior significantly, and a few other studies of mammalian species have found that 

social  play  increased  post-feeding  sessions  (Cordoni,  2009;  Pellis,  1991).  The 

frequency of play and/or affiliative behaviors before or after feeding sessions may be 

worth investigating as a measure for motivational state of hunger (Pellis, 1991). This 

could aid management of routines on the commercial scale, for example milking and 

grazing  schedules  affecting  cow  behavior  and  productivity  (Ketelaar-de  Lauwere  et 

al.,  1999),  and  would  be  particularly  pertinent  as  the  industry  continues  to  trial 

automated  milking  systems  (entry  and  timings  under  animal  control,  Flury  and 

Gygax, 2016). Elements of the dolphins’ behavioral patterns could also be likened to 

findings  on  human  routines.  For  instance  Stevenson  and  Lee  (1990)  used 

differences  in  school  schedules  to  highlight  the  children’s  need  for  recess 

(unstructured  free-time)  since  it  gives  “opportunities  for  play”,  something  which  we 

found juvenile dolphins to engage in specifically in-between controlled sessions. This 

would suggest that children might also be motivated to interact socially shortly after 

the lessons end, and therefore planning spaces where children can interact socially 

and  freely  in  recess  times  might  be  beneficial  and  improve  their  attention  spans 

(Holmes et al., 2006; Stevenson and Lee, 1990). Without doubt further research with 

human  subjects  is  needed  to  investigate  this,  especially  given  that  the  dolphins’ 

sessions included food provision, but the similarities could be worth considering from 

both sides.  

Conclusions 

 

 

	

Through observations of captive bottlenose dolphins we found that slow-close 

synchronous  swimming,  age-dependent  play  and  anticipatory  behavior  were 

modulated  by  the  timing  of  daily  human-controlled  periods.  That  social  behaviors 

such  as  synchronous  swimming  and  play  were  affected,  which  would  seem  to  not 

have  as  clear,  direct  connection  with  the  occurrence  of  training  sessions,  suggests 

that  the  schedule  of  sessions  acts  as  an  entraining  cue  for  the  general  daily 

behavioral  patterns.  We  use  these  preliminary  findings  to  tentatively  suggest 

implications for dolphin welfare, such as the provision of enrichment following a short 

Chapter	2:	Identifying	potential	welfare	parameters						71	

	
delay  after  sessions  and  the  consideration  of  daily  behavioral  rhythms  when 

conducting welfare assessments. Furthermore, the three modulated behaviors have 

all been previously suggested as indicators of dolphin welfare or affective state, but 

further investigation is needed to discover the actual link between each behavior and 

welfare  and  we  suggest  potential  directions  to  achieve  this.  Parallels  from  our 

findings can be drawn to controlled periods experienced by other species and even 

humans,  providing  further  evidence  that  daily  schedules  are  closely  linked  to 

behavior in an individual’s free-time.

Résumé 
Les tests de biais cognitif mesurent la variation dans les évaluations émotionnelles et 

sont des méthodes validées pour évaluer les états affectifs des animaux. Cependant, 

le  lien  entre  des  comportements  sociaux  et  les  biais  cognitifs  n'a  pas  encore  été 

examiné.  Les  grands  dauphins  sont  une  espèce  sociable  pour  qui  la  recherche  de 

bien-être  est  importante,  ils  sont  ainsi  un  bon  modèle  pour  tester  une  telle 

association. Nous avons adapté un test de biais de jugement d'emplacement spatial 

sur  huit  grands  dauphins  captifs  pour  examiner  le  lien  entre  le  biais  cognitif  et  le 

comportement  social,  au  cours  duquel  nous  avons  conduit  des  observations 

comportementales  en  dehors  des  sessions  d’entrainement  et  nous  n'avons  pas 

expérimentalement  initié  d'état  affectif.  Les  sujets  ont  montré  des  différences 

individuelles stables de biais au cours des trois jours de test. En outre, les dauphins 

qui montraient le plus de nage synchronisée, un comportement affiliatif fondamental, 

ont jugé des signaux ambiguës significativement plus avec optimisme. Nos données 

sur  le  long  terme  ont  montré  que  le  biais  cognitif  et  la  fréquence  de  nage 

synchronisée ont été significativement associés jusqu'à deux mois précédant le test, 

mais pas avant cela, suggérant qu'ici les différences de biais cognitif ont été reflétées 

par  des  états  affectifs  transitoires  plutôt  que  par  des  traits  à  plus  long  terme.  Nous 

formulons  une  hypothèse  selon  laquelle  la  réalisation  de  nage  synchronisée  peut 

initier  des  états  affectifs  et-ou  être  initiée  par  eux;  de  manière  générale,  la  nage 

synchronisée montre un fort potentiel pour être un indicateur d'état affectif dans cette 

espèce et dans d’autres.

Abstract 

Cognitive  bias  tests  measure  variation  in  emotional  appraisal  and  are  validated 

methods  to  evaluate  animals’  affective  states.  However,  the  link  between  social 

behaviours and cognitive bias has not yet been investigated. Bottlenose dolphins are 

a  gregarious  species  for  whom  welfare  research  is  increasing  in  importance,  and 

thus  are  a  good  model  to  test  such  an  association.  We  adapted  a  spatial  location 

judgement  bias  test  for  eight  captive  bottlenose  dolphins  to  investigate  the  link 

between  cognitive  bias  and  social  behaviour,  where  we  conducted  behavioural 

observations  outside  of  training  sessions  and  did  not  experimentally  induce  an 

affective  state.  Subjects  showed  stable  individual  differences  in  cognitive  biases 

across  the  three  test  days.  Furthermore,  dolphins  showing  more  synchronous 

swimming,  a  fundamental  affiliative  behaviour,  judged  ambiguous  cues  significantly 

more  optimistically.  Our  longer-term  data  showed  cognitive  bias  and  synchronous 

swimming  frequency  were  significantly  associated  for  up  to  two  months  preceding 

the test, but disappeared prior to that, suggesting that here cognitive bias differences 

were  reflected  by  transitory  affective  states  rather  than  longer-term  traits.  We 

hypothesise  that  conducting  synchronous  swimming  may  induce  affective  states 

and/or  be  induced  by  them;  either  way,  it  has  strong  potential  as  an  indicator  of 

affective state in this species and beyond.

1. Introduction 

Cognitive  bias  has  been  the  subject  of  recent  interest  due  to  its  successful 

application  to  animal  welfare  investigations,  and  describes  the  effects  of  emotional 

experiences  on  cognitive  functioning  (chiefly  attention,  memory  and  judgement, 

Mendl  et  al.,  2009).  In  many  animal  species  there  is  evidence  to  support  the 

experience  of  emotions,  which  are  then  thought  to  form  various  affective  states 

(Boissy et al., 2007; Mendl et al., 2009; Panksepp, 2005). Welfare can be generally 

described  as  the  balance  between  positive  and  negative  affective  states  (Spruijt  et 

al.,  2001)  and  welfare  indicators  are  sought  in  order  to  measure  characteristics  of 

these states (Mendl et al., 2010): therefore the fields of animal emotion, welfare and 

cognitive bias research are all closely interlinked. 

Cognitive  biases  are  most 

likely  adaptive: 

for  example, 

individuals 

in 

environments,  which  induce  anxious  or  fearful  emotions  may  enhance  their  fitness 

through biased attention or judgement towards negative stimuli (Mendl et al., 2009). 

In  humans,  certain  cognitive  biases  in  perhaps  a  more  complex  form  are  known  as 

optimism  and  pessimism  (Paul  et  al.,  2005),  and  a  congruent  finding  is  that  being 

more optimistic is correlated to better subjective well-being (see reviews by Carver et 

al., 2010; Peterson, 2000). Soon after the first animal judgement bias paradigm was 

applied to laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus, Harding et al., 2004), a handful of other 

mammalian  and  bird  species  were  tested,  and  in  the  last  few  years  the  number  of 

studies  has  increased  exponentially  (latest  reviews  by  Bethell,  2015;  Roelofs  et  al., 

2016).  In  the  vast  majority  of  studies  an  experimental  condition  was  imposed  to 

induce  a  certain  affect,  with  results  convincingly  showing  that  animals  with  induced 

negative  affective  states/  poorer  welfare 

judge  ambiguous  stimuli  more 

“pessimistically”  (Mendl  et  al.,  2009)  (hereafter  discussed  as  animal  optimism  and 

pessimism without forgetting the caveat that this is an anthropocentric concept).  

Many  cognitive  bias  studies  have  induced  affective  states  through  imposing 

conditions 

involving  physical  stress  (Bateson  et  al.,  2011),  pharmacological 

treatments  (e.g.  Enkel  et  al.,  2010),  and  chronic  environmental  and  psychosocial 

stress  (e.g.  Doyle  et  al.,  2011;  Papciak  et  al.,  2013).  Although  past  results  have 

mostly  concurred  with  the  predicted  affect  being  induced,  some  studies  have 

reported  surprising  directionality  in  cognitive  biases  (Bethell,  2015;  Mendl  et  al., 

2009). It has recently been asserted that the individual’s moods and affective state, 

occurring  independently  from  the  affect  induced  experimentally,  might  also  be 

impacting  cognitive  bias  results  (Baciadonna  and  McElligott,  2015;  Wichman  et  al., 

2012). Affective states are defined as combinations of discrete emotions which result 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						77	

	
from  the  opportunities  for  threats  or  rewards  in  the  surrounding  environment,  and 

moods are the longer-term result of experiencing affective states (Mendl et al., 2010; 

Nettle and Bateson, 2012). Since performance of behaviour is in response to current 

threats  or  rewards  (Webster,  2005),  measuring  an  animal’s  behaviour  in  its  home 

environment might indicate its affective state/mood and thus also be correlated with 

cognitive  bias  results  (Bateson  and  Nettle,  2015).  A  strong  candidate  for  such 

behaviours  would  be  those  involved  in  social  interactions:  for  example,  affiliative 

social behaviour (e.g. gentle tactile interactions, play, allogrooming) is thought to be 

rewarding and associated with long-term positive affective states (Boissy et al., 2007; 

Mendl  et  al.,  2010;  Yeates  and  Main,  2008).  Furthermore,  it  was  recently 

recommended  that  cognitive  bias  tests  be  used  specifically  to  investigate  the 

contribution  of  social  interactions  to  affective  state  (Wichman  et  al.,  2012).  When 

investigating  the  correlations  between  behaviours  and  cognitive  biases,  longer-term 

data  would  be  invaluable  for  conclusions  on  whether  temporary  affective  states  or 

more  stable  behavioural  traits  are  being  seen  (Roelofs  et  al.,  2016):  very  few  past 

studies have tested the long-term persistence of their results (Bethell, 2015). 

Dolphins  are  gregarious  marine  mammals  with  complex  societies  and 

supposedly advanced cognitive abilities, and thus have long stimulated the interest of 

cognition  researchers  (Marino  et  al.,  2007;  Schusterman  et  al.,  2013).  Thus  far  the 

meaning  and  effect  of  social  behaviours  on  the  dolphins  themselves  has  not  been 

explored:  for  example  the  influence  of  dolphin  play  on  affective  state  (Kuczaj  and 

Eskelinen,  2014;  as  with  other  species,  Held  and  Špinka  2011).  The  relationship 

between agonistic behaviour and affective state is thought to be complex in dolphin 

societies,  with  certain  emotions  often  hard  to  pinpoint  in  the  animals’  multi-modal 

displays (Kuczaj et al., 2013). Dolphin behaviours such as gentle tactile interactions 

and synchronous swimming are some of the more direct indicators of social affiliation 

(Holobinko and Waring, 2010; Kuczaj et al., 2013), and therefore could be linked to 

positive  emotions  as  well.  There  is  very  little  research  available  on  emotions  and 

their indicators in dolphin species (Kuczaj et al., 2013), but interest for their discovery 

in  other  animals  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007;  Mendl  et  al.,  2010)  is  likely  to  stimulate  an 

analogous  increase  in  such  studies,  fuelled  further  by  questions  over  their  welfare 

status in captivity (Clegg et al., 2015; Gygax, 1993).  

Despite  bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  being  the  most  studied 

cetacean species (Hill and Lackups, 2010), and more pertinently the most commonly 

kept  in  captivity  (Pryor  and  Norris,  1998),  cognitive  bias  tests  have  not  yet  been 

conducted  with  them,  or  indeed  any  marine  species  or  animals  kept  in  zoos.  Such 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						78	

	
tests  could  increase  our  knowledge  of  dolphin  affective  states  and  how  social 

behaviours might impact them. In the only previous study linking cognitive bias and 

social behaviour, Lalot and colleagues recently found that pair-housing was linked to 

optimistic  judgements  in  domestic  canaries  (Serinus  canaria)  (Lalot  et  al.,  2017), 

while  two  other  studies  using  cognitive  bias  tests  have  suggested  links  between 

dominance  rank  and  optimism  in  two  primate  species  (Bateson  and  Nettle,  2015; 

Schino  et  al.,  2016).  These  studies  have  started  to  provide  evidence  of  the 

‘emotional  consequences  of  social  behaviour’  (Schino  et  al.,  2016),  but  it  would  be 

useful  to  delve  deeper  into  which  aspects  of  social  behaviours  are  linked  to 

emotions,  for  example  through  studying  the  opportunistic  performance  of  various 

behaviours in the social repertoire. Cognitive bias testing in dolphins would be readily 

applicable  and  useful  for  research  on  this  group  for  a  number  of  other  reasons: 

conditioning  to  the  chosen  task  would  likely  be  feasible  since  captive  dolphins  are 

highly  trainable  using  positive  reinforcement  methods  (Brando,  2010),  it  has  the 

potential  to  validate  potential  welfare  indicators,  and  the  results  may  enhance  our 

knowledge of dolphin emotions and affective states, which is lacking at present. 

Consequently a study was designed to investigate cognitive bias in a group of 

Atlantic  bottlenose  dolphins  at  Parc  Astérix  dolphinarium  (Plailly,  France).  The  two 

aims  of  this  research  were:  (i)  to  test  whether  individual  differences  in  judgement 

biases  were  present  and  repeatable  over  testing  days.  Although  this  has  not  been 

investigated with dolphins before, we expected cognitive biases to be present since 

they  have  been  found  in  many  other  species.  Finding  individually  repeatable 

responses  would  show  that  the  methodology  is  eliciting  more  than  a  chance 

phenomenon.  In  part  (ii)  we  wanted  to  test  whether  the  cognitive  bias  results  were 

correlated  with  measures  of  social  behaviour  taken  around  and  prior  to  the  testing 

period.  The  social  behaviours  were  chosen  to  reflect  the  most  common  social 

interactions  likely  to  take  place,  and  included  social  play,  synchronous  swimming, 

and  agonistic  behaviour.  We  predicted  that  a  higher  frequency  of  synchronous 

swimming  may  be  associated  with  optimistic  judgements:  it  is  a  common  social 

behaviour where two animals or more swim in (near) unison with each other (Connor 

et  al.,  2006a;  Sakai  et  al.,  2010)  and  is  likely  a  proxy  indicator  for  higher  affiliation 

and  social  bonding  in  the  group  (Connor  et  al.,  2006a).  Social  play  is  generally 

affiliative and thus higher levels might also be linked to more optimistic judgements, 

with  agonistic  behaviour  perhaps  correlating  with  pessimistic  judgements  if  it  is 

indeed  an  indicator  of  stress  (Broom  and  Johnson,  1993).  The  results  could  make 

headway  towards  understanding  dolphin  affective  states,  and  would  integrate  data 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						79	

	
from  cognitive  and  behavioural  measures  which  is  a  more  accurate  approach  to 

assessing  emotions,  and  therefore  welfare,  as  opposed  to  using  just  one  category 

(Boissy et al., 2007; Désiré et al., 2002). We also took social behavioural data in the 

months  prior  to  testing,  since  persistence  of  links  to  cognitive  bias  results  would 

reveal  importantly  whether  transitory  affective  states,  or  stable  behavioural  traits, 

were being measured.  

2. Material and methods 

2.1 Study animals and facility 

Our study involved eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) housed at 

Parc Astérix (Plailly, France) in an outdoor pool conjoined to two indoor pools, with a 
total volume of 3790 m3 of water where access was always free between pools. The 

age  range  of  the  study  subjects  was  from  4  to  43  years  old,  and  consisted  of  4 

females: all adults of 11 years or over (age classification taken from Smolker et al., 

1992), and 4 males: 2 adults and 2 juveniles; not all animals were related, and three 

were  wild  caught  while  the  remaining  five  were  captive  born.  A  female  calf  of  6 

months was also present in the group but not included in the study as she was too 

young to participate in training sessions. The dolphins’ diets consisted of a variety of 

fish and squid species, and during multiple sessions each dolphin received between 

5  and  12  kg  per  day  depending  on  individual  needs.  The  park  was  closed  to  the 

public  for  the  duration  of  the  experiment.  “Training  sessions”  involved  completing 

tasks  conditioned  using  positive  reinforcement  (see  Laule  et  al.,  2003)  for 

explanation),  and  could  involve  medical  training,  show  practice,  novel  behaviours, 

free-feeds, and play sessions.  

2.2 Cognitive bias test methodology 

2.2.1 Test protocol: a Go-Go spatial task  

The task required the dolphins to “touch the target with rostrum and return to 

the  trainer”,  where  the  target  position  (the  “cue”)  would  move  between  the  extreme 

left  and  right  of  a  semi-circle,  and  eventually  to  the  ambiguous  positions  along  the 

arc in-between (Fig. 6). Once the animal returned to the trainer, they received either 

a  “Positive”  or  “Less-positive”  reward.  This  is  a  Go-Go  task,  where  a  response  is 

required 

for  both  extreme  cues,  and 

thus  avoided  potential  problems  with 

generalisation  gradients  (discussed  in  detail  in  Roelofs  et  al.,  2016).  This  spatial 

location task was adapted closely from Burman and co-authors’ studies (Burman et 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						80	

	
al., 2011, 2009, 2008) with laboratory rats and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), and 

was chosen here because spatial localisation is a salient feature in dolphin ecology 

(Shane  et  al.,  1986),  and  a  simple  locomotory  behaviour  permitting  the  differential 

responses (latency to return to trainer, measured in s) to be seen would be relatively 

easy for dolphins to learn. 

 

A  3-step  protocol  was  developed  with  strict  criteria  regulating  progression  to 

the  next  stage.  The  animals  first  participated  in  trials  involving  only  the  conditioned 

(Positive  and  Less-positive)  cues  until 

they  showed  pronounced,  sustained 

differences in return latencies. They then entered the true testing phase where each 

ambiguous cue (Near-positive, Middle, Near-less-positive) was presented among the 

conditioned  cues  once  per  day,  over  three  consecutive  test  days,  and  the  return 

latencies  measured.  The  5  cues  (i.e.  target  positions)  were  set  in  an  arc  shape,  all 

equidistant  from  each  other  and  the  opposite  ‘beach’  area  of  the  pool  where  the 

dolphin would start each trial (Fig. 6). The test was completed by the eight dolphins 

(4 males, 4 females) during January and February 2016.

are shown of the conditioned (Positive, P; Less-positive, LP) and ambiguous (Near-

positive,  NP;  Middle,  M;  Near-less-positive,  NLP)  cues,  test  subject,  and  personnel 

involved.  Note  that  for  analyses  an  average  of  return  latency  times  from  all 

ambiguous cues (NP, M, NLP) was used. 

2.2.2 Positive and Less-positive rewards 

When  returning  from  touching  the  target  at  the  “Positive”  position,  the 

dolphins received a large reward of one herring as well as a few seconds of applause 

and eye contact, and from the “Less-positive position” they received a small reward 

of  just  the  applause  and  eye  contact,  as  well  as  for  the  ambiguous  cue  positions 

(Near-positive, Middle and Near-less-positive). Eye contact and applause on its own 

is already used in dolphin training techniques as a secondary reinforcer (Neto et al., 

2016), where it has “acquired reinforcing value through learning by being paired with 

events that are already reinforcing” (Brando, 2010). The test’s Positive and the Less-

positive  rewards  were  verified  by  animal  care  staff  at  Parc  Astérix  as  representing 

larger and smaller reinforcement respectively, and being clearly distinct. All dolphins 

seemed to prefer herring from the other types of fish (herring are relatively larger and 

have a high fat content, Fisher et al., 1992), and reacting positively (e.g. approaching 

and  contacting  trainers)  in  response  to  applause  and  eye  contact  (dolphins  have 

been  shown  to  closely  monitor  attentional  state  through  human  gaze,  Pack  and 

Herman, 2006).  

Differential  positive  reinforcement  for  the  extreme  cues  has  been  applied 

before in cognitive bias testing and offers advantages including less risk of extinction 

of behaviour and frustration, avoidance of difficult analysis of trials with no response, 

and a generally more positive experience for the animals (Keen et al., 2014).  

2.2.3 Testing within the social group  

There  are  no  pre-established  methods  for  testing  cognitive  bias  in  dolphin 

species, and since separating the dolphins in Parc Astérix would have caused undue 

stress,  focal  cognitive  bias  tests  were  conducted  during  training  sessions  when  the 

animals could be segregated behaviourally i.e. under stimulus control. Testing within 

the social group was  recently conducted for the first time in cognitive  bias research 

(Nogueira  et  al.,  2015),  and  the  several  advantages  were  highlighted  in  a  recent 

review  (Roelofs  et  al.,  2016).  Since  our  test  was  conducted  on  each  dolphin  in  the 

presence  of  all  group  members,  our  choice  of  a  spatial  discrimination  task  was 

conducive  to  reducing  the  likelihood  of  conspecifics  learning  about  the  test:  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	

	
example,  using  underwater  sound  cues  would  have  been  inappropriate  since  they 

would be heard in all areas of the pool and therefore accessible to all dolphins during 

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						82	

each trial. 

2.2.4 The 3-step progression of the cognitive bias test 

Step 1: Teaching the task behaviour 

In  the  first  step  of  the  process,  the  animals  were  taught  to  respond  to  the 

trainer’s signal (hand gesture) by swimming to the opposite side of the pool, touching 

the  target  submerged  50cm  under  the  water’s  surface,  and  returning  to  the  trainer. 

The target was made out of an orange foam cylinder attached securely to a wooden 

shaft. The person holding the target would ‘bridge’ the behaviour (a whistle which lets 

the animal  know  it  has  completed the correct behaviour (Laule et al., 2003)), which 

signalled to the dolphins that they should return to the original trainer. The addition of 

the person whistling to signal the correct behaviour was necessary to encourage the 

dolphin  to  return  to  the  original  trainer,  allowing  them  to  be  the  one  to  provide 

reinforcement  and  meaning  only  one  trainer  was  needed  for  the  tests.  During  this 

first  step  of  the  test,  the  “Test  area”  (Fig.  6)  was  avoided  and  the  target  placed  at 

different  positions  around  the  entire  pool  in  order  to  not  establish  any  conditioned 

responses  in  the  Test  area.  The  criteria  to  confirm  that  the  dolphins  had  learnt  the 

behaviour was that they must complete the behaviour correctly in at least 11 out of 

12 trials (92%): once this was achieved they passed on to Step 2. 

Step 2: Conditioning the responses to Positive and Less-positive cues 

In Steps 2 and 3, the structured setting of the trials commenced: 12 trials (1 

set) were conducted in one session, with three brief pauses after every three trials. 

During  the  pauses,  the  trainers  asked  the  animal  a  few  simple,  low-energy,  known 

behaviours  and  reinforced  them  equally  (always  with  one  small  fish).  The  pauses 

were necessary to maintain the interest in the cognitive bias tests: the dolphins each 

know  around  one  hundred  different  conditioned  behaviours  and  are  accustomed  to 

being asked a variety of them in their regular training sessions. In prior trial runs of 

the  test  method,  when  there  were  not  any  pauses,  the  animals  left  the  trainer 

frequently  and  showed  more  refusals  to  conduct  the  task.  When  the  standardised 

pauses  were  introduced  the  animals  stayed  with  the  trainers  for  the  entirety  of  the 

test. No more than 1 set of 12 trials were conducted per dolphin per day, and there 

was  no  more  than  three  days  between  consecutive  testing  days.  The  response 

variable for cognitive bias analysis was the latency to return to the trainer (in s). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						83	

Subjects were randomly assigned either the extreme left or right of the arc as 

their “Positive” reinforced position. For the first trail of each session, the trainer and 

person  holding  the  target  were  blind  to  which  were  the  Positive  and  Less-positive 

positions, since the experimenter (IC) relayed the target position just before each trial 

and  the  reinforcement  type  during  the  animal’s  return  to  the  trainer:  however,  once 

the first trial of the set was completed the cue values were unavoidably revealed. For 

both  Steps  2  and  3,  a  pseudorandom  order  of  the  positions  was  used  where  there 

were no more than two consecutive Positive or Less-positive trials (as conducted in 

Burman et al., 2011). If the animal performed the incorrect behaviour, this was noted 

and  the  behaviour  was  asked  again;  in  practice,  never  more  than  two  non-

consecutive  refusals  occurred  during  a  set  of  trials.  Also  noted  was  whether  any 

other  dolphin  came  within  a  body  length  of  the  test  subject,  and  if  this  caused  a 

distraction  where  the  subject  changed  trajectory,  the  trial  was  repeated.  All  trials 

were  filmed  from  both  a  GoPro®  HD  Hero  2  at  the  surface  and  a  GoPro®  Hero  4 

(GoPro, Inc., San Matteo, CA, USA) placed underwater to measure return latencies. 

Videos were synchronized a posteriori. 

In  order  to  be  sure  that  the  animals  were  responding  differently  to  the  two 

extreme cues, criteria were adapted from the similar spatial task used with domestic 

dogs  (Burman  et  al.,  2011).  Here,  to  continue  to  Step  3,  the  return  latency  of  the 

dolphins  in  Step  2  had  to  be  two  seconds  longer  from  the  Less-positive  cue  than 

from the Positive cue, for five consecutive trials. 

Step 3: Presenting the ambiguous cues 

In  Step  3  the  ambiguous  cues  at  the  Near-positive,  Middle,  and  Near-less-

positive  positions  were  presented  in  the  sets  of  12  trials.  Each  ambiguous  cue  was 

presented once each per 12 trials, and with at least two conditioned trials in between, 

following  the  same  pseudorandom  order  as  in  Step  2.  The  ambiguous  cues  were 

reinforced similarly to the Less-positive cue: with a few seconds of eye contact and 

applause  from  the  trainer.  The  12  trials  for  Step  3  were  conducted  three  times  (to 

avoid  loss  of  stimulus  ambiguity,  Roelofs  et  al.,  2016),  once  per  day  on  three 

consecutive days for each dolphin. 

2.2.5 Calculation of cognitive bias response variables for analysis 

The  dolphins’  return  latency  (in  s)  from  the  target  to  the  trainer,  where 

reinforcement was given, was used to analyse cognitive bias. Return latencies were 

calculated  from  the  video  footage  taken  and  were  measured  from  the  instance  the 

	
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						84	

	
animal broke contact with the target to when its head surfaced above water in front of 

the  trainer.  We  calculated  an  average  of  the  return  times  from  all  ambiguous  cues 

(Fig.  6)  to  be  able  to  have  one  measure  of  the  response  to  ambiguous  positions, 

since  past  studies  have  shown  varying  associations  in  relation  to  each  ambiguous 

cue  when  analysed  separately,  without  being  able  to  attribute  meaning  to  the 

differences (Mendl et al., 2009; Salmeto et al., 2011). We then used as our response 

variable  the  percentage  deviation  of  this  ambiguous  cue  average  from  each 

individual’s average return latency from the Positive and Less-positive (conditioned) 

cues.  This  allowed  us  to  control  for  the  different  swim  speeds  of  the  dolphins,  and 

produced  a  measure  of  individual  response  to  ambiguous  cues  relative  to  the 

conditioned ones. 

2.3 Collection of social behavioural data 

During  the  3-day  cognitive  bias  testing  period  for  each  dolphin  (January/February 

2016) there were also five behavioural observations (5-min focal observations, scan 

sampling  every  15s;  Mann,  1999;  Martin  and  Bateson,  1986)  conducted  per  day 

during  the  dolphins’  “free-time”  between  training  sessions,  for  a  total  of  15 

observations  per  animal.  In  order  not  to  bias  the  observations  towards  times  where 

certain behaviours would be more likely, one observation was taken shortly before (≤ 

15 min) a training session, one shortly after (≤ 15 min), and the remaining three were 

taken at randomly chosen times in-between sessions.  

 

For  analysis  the  scans  were  converted  to  a  percentage  of  total  scans  per 

observation  (i.e.  to  correct  for  non-visible  scans),  and  are  therefore  described  as 

frequencies  hereafter.  Observations  were  all  carried  out  by  the  same  person  (IC), 

using  a  behavioural  repertoire  containing  nine  behaviours  classified  within  three 

categories  (synchronous  swimming,  social  play,  and  agonistic;  see  definitions  and 

their sources in Thesis ethogram, Chapter 2). Synchronous swimming (as we define 

it) between mothers and dependent calves is very frequent in the first 6 months of life 

(Gubbins et al., 1999), and since one dolphin had a 6 month old calf during the study, 

synchronous swimming between her and the calf was not recorded, unless there was 

a third dolphin involved. As well as collecting these social behaviour measures during 

the  days  where  cognitive  bias  was  tested,  they  were  also  taken  on  a  longer-term 

basis:  near-daily  observations  were  taken  for  the  four  months  preceding  testing. 

These  data  were  organised  into  2-month  long  periods  preceding  the  first  day  of 

testing, i.e. 0 to 2 months and 2 to 4 months before.  

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						85	

	
Data analysis  

Statistical  analyses  were  done  with  R,  version  3.1.1  (R  Development  Core  Team, 

2016),  and  were  guided  by  advice  from  a  recent  review  concerning  analysis  of 

cognitive  bias  data  (Gygax,  2014).  For  our  first  question  regarding  whether  test 

criteria were maintained, we used the Fisher-Pitman permutation test (package coin, 

Hothorn et al., 2006). 

To  test  for  the  repeatability  of  individuals’  latency  times  over  the  three  test 

days we applied an intra-class correlation based on a linear mixed effects model with 

permutation  tests  (package  rptR,  Nakagawa  and  Schielzeth,  2010),  where  we 

calculated  the  repeatability  (R;  based  on  10,000  bootstrap  runs)  of  the  individual 

return latencies from ambiguous cues (in s) measured during the 3 days of testing. In 

order  to  correct  for  different  swim  speeds  of  individuals  we  used  the  relative 

latencies, which were the percentage deviation of the ambiguous cue latencies from 

the averaged conditioned cue (Positive and Less-positive) latencies. In doing so, we 

used  individual  identity  as  a  random  factor  (Nakagawa  and  Schielzeth,  2010). 

Furthermore,  the  model  included  sex  as  a  further  between-subject  effect.  However, 

this factor was not significant (p > 0.10) and was removed from the model before this 

was re-calculated. 

 

In order to calculate the associations between cognitive bias test results and 

the  three  different  social  behaviours,  we  used  linear  regression  models  with 

permutation  tests  (package  lmPerm,  Wheeler,  2010).  Such  permutation  tests  are 

particularly  adequate  when  sample  sizes  are  moderate  and  do  not  have  any 

assumptions regarding normal distribution of residuals (Good, 2005). The behaviours 

were each tested separately as independent variables. Furthermore, we included sex 

of the animals as a factor in all models. However, this factor (including an interaction 

with the respective behaviour of each model) was never significant (all p > 0.10), and 

thus was always reduced from the models before these were re-calculated.  

3. Results 

3.1 Maintenance of test criteria 

During the 3-day test period where ambiguous cues were presented in addition to the 

conditioned  cues,  the  return  latency  from  the  Less-positive  cue  was  significantly 

longer,  on  average  by  2.0  seconds  (min:  1.5  s,  max:  2.4  s)  than  from  the  Positive 

position (Fisher-Pitman test with 10,000 permutations: Z = 11.72, p < 0.001).  

3.2 Repeatability in individual judgement patterns 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						86	

	
The  latencies  to  return  from  the  ambiguous  cues  (averaged  over  the  Near-positive, 

Middle, and Near-less-positive) were significantly repeatable across the three days of 

testing.  This  was  the  case  with  respect  to  the  absolute  latencies  in  seconds  (intra-

class  correlation  with  10,000  permutations:  R  =  0.888,  p  =  0.001)  as  well  as  when 

using the relative values, calculated as the percentage deviation from the averaged 

return latency from the conditioned cues (R = 0.466, p = 0.015). 

3.3. Association between different behavioural parameters and optimistic judgements 

3.3.1 Short-term associations 

There  was  a  significant  and  negative  correlation  between  the  frequency  of 

synchronous  swimming  and  the  averaged,  relative  latency  to  return  from  the 
ambiguous cues (linear regression with 10,000 permutations: R2 = 0.679, β = -0.419, 

p  =  0.013;  Fig.  7a).  That  is,  dolphins  showing  more  synchronous  swimming around 

the  testing  period  returned  more  quickly,  which  signifies  a  more  optimistic-like 

judgement.  The  other  behavioural  parameters,  social  play  and  agonistic  behaviour, 

were  not  significantly  associated  to  return  latency  from  the  ambiguous  cues  (p  > 

0.10). 

3.3.2 Longer-term associations 

When considering the behaviours quantified during regular observations over 

a period of 0 to 2 months prior to the testing period, we found similar results. Again, 

there  was  a  significant  and  negative  correlation  between  the  frequency  of 

synchronous swimming and the animals’ averaged, relative latency to return from the 
ambiguous  cues  (R2  =  0.541,  β  =  -0.371,  p  =  0.044;  Fig.  7b).  Social  play  and 

agonistic behaviour were not significantly associated to the animals’ latency to return 

(all p > 0.10). 

During  the  period  of  2  to  4  months  prior  to  testing,  there  were  no  significant 

associations  between  any  social  behaviour  quantified  and  the  animals’  averaged 

latency to return from the ambiguous cues (all p > 0.10).

Fig.  7  Cognitive  bias  results  predicted  by  synchronous  swimming  frequency  in 

bottlenose  dolphins.  (a)  The  animals’  return  latencies  to  ambiguous  cues  were 

significantly  correlated  with  the  frequency  of  synchronous  swimming  behaviour 

during  the  3-day  test  period,  where  those  fastest  to  return  also  showed  the  highest 

frequency  of  synchronous  swimming.  This  same  relationship  was  present  (b)  with 

behavioural  data  taken  up  to  2  months  before  the  testing  period,  where  those  who 

were more frequently synchronous swimming also returned significantly more quickly 

in the subsequent cognitive bias tests. The dotted line represents individual average 

return latencies, and thus low and negative y-axis values correspond to faster return 

times  and  optimistic-like  judgements,  and  the  higher  and  positive  deviations  to 

pessimistic-like judgements. See text for statistics. 

4. Discussion 

We found that captive bottlenose dolphins showed stable individual difference 

in  judgement  biases  across  three  testing  days.  These  differences  were  correlated 

with the frequency of synchronous swimming, a parameter reflecting social affiliative 

behaviour,  shown  around  and  up  to  two  months  prior  to  the  time  of  testing,  but  for 

which  the  association  disappeared  when  studying  behaviour  between  two  and  four 

months prior to testing. Dolphins who conducted more synchronous swimming in the 

	

 

 

 

	

	
time outside of training sessions made more optimistic-like judgements of ambiguous 

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						88	

cues. 

4.1 Test protocol with dolphins 

There  have  been  no  previous  cognitive  bias  studies  in  zoo  or  aquarium 

facilities  (Bethell,  2015),  and  few  where  testing  involves  positive  reinforcement  only 

and  occurs  within  the  animals’  social  groups  (Keen  et  al.,  2014;  Nogueira  et  al., 

2015).  Roelofs  and  co-authors  (2016)  recommended  that  testing  in  social  groups 

should be a future direction of cognitive bias experimentation to facilitate application 

for welfare assessment. A number of initial validations for a judgement bias test with 

dolphins can be taken from our results: the animals successfully progressed through 

the  stages  of  the  test;  they  maintained  their  responses  to  the  conditioned  cues 

throughout the presentation of ambiguous cues; and, the clearest indication that the 

test  was  functional,  the  dolphins  had  individual  profiles  of  judgement  biases,  which 

were significantly repeatable over the three test days.  

4.2 Cognitive bias and social behaviour 

Higher frequencies of synchronous swimming in the dolphins’ free-time were 

associated  with  more  optimistic-like  judgements  towards  the  ambiguous  cues,  and 

such  a  relationship  persisted  up  to  two  months  prior  to  testing  days.  Synchronous 

swimming  is  generally  considered  an  adaptive  (Fellner  et  al.,  2013)  and  affiliative 

behaviour (Connor et al., 2006a; Sakai et al., 2010), as well as a foundation for other 

social  behaviours  (Fellner  et  al.,  2013).  Social  support  is  thought  to  significantly 

buffer  stress  in  dolphins  (Fellner  et  al.,  2013;  Waples  and  Gales,  2002)  and  thus 

unsurprisingly  higher  levels  of  conspecific  bonding  have  been  shown  to  increase 

survivability  (Frère  et  al.,  2010;  Stanton  and  Mann,  2012),  similar  to  other  animals 

(e.g.  DeVries  et  al.,  2003;  Rödel  and  Starkloff,  2014).  The  lack  of  dolphin  emotion 

research  (Kuczaj  et  al.,  2013)  means  we  cannot  make  easily  speculate  about  the 

presence  of  positive  emotions,  but  evidence  in  other  mammalian  species  suggests 

affiliative  behaviours  are  indeed  linked  to  positive  affective  states  (Boissy  et  al., 

2007).  Our  results  are  correlative  and  thus  cannot  confirm  the  causality  between 

synchronous  swimming  and  optimistic-like 

judgements.  However,  since  past 

cognitive  bias  testing  has  shown  that  more  optimistic  judgements  generally  reflect 

more  positive  emotional  states  (Mendl  et  al.,  2009;  Roelofs  et  al.,  2016),  one 

explanation  for  our  findings  might  be  that  conducting  more  synchronous  swimming 

likely  results  in  higher  social  bonding  and  affiliation,  and  this  may  in  turn  lead  to  a 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						89	

	
more  positive  internal  affective  state  as  evidenced  by  the  cognitive  bias  results. 

Those  animals  who  had  less  affiliative  social  interactions  through  synchronous 

swimming  may  have  experienced  more  negative  affective  states,  making  more 

pessimistic judgements. This hypothesis is supported by findings from other species 

and  humans:  domestic  canaries  housed  together  made  more  optimistic  judgements 

(Lalot et al., 2017), and a study on zoo-housed Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) 

found  the  more  sociable  subjects  had  higher  subjective  well-being,  as  assessed  by 

their  keepers  (Weiss  et  al.,  2011).  Therefore  with  dolphins,  we  might  assume  that 

those  conducting  more  synchronous  swimming  are  actively  choosing  to  be  in  the 

company  of  conspecifics,  inducing  positive  affective  states  and  leading  to  more 

optimistic  judgements.  In  the  future,  synchronous  swimming  frequency  might 

therefore merit investigation as an element of overall welfare assessments.  

 

  

4.3 Longer-term persistence of cognitive bias predictor, and future directions 

As humans we can have a consistent, personality-level degree of optimism, termed 

“dispositional  optimism”  (Peterson,  2000),  as  well  as  shorter-term  optimistic  or 

pessimistic  biases  induced  by  temporary  mood  states  and  salient  changes  in 

environment  (Carver  et  al.,  2010;  Segerstrom,  2007).  In  our  study  we  took  longer-

term  behavioural  data  to  see  whether  any  associations  with  cognitive  bias  were 

longer-lasting (i.e. stable behavioural traits) or more transitory in nature (i.e. reflecting 

transient affective states). Our results showed that the correlation between cognitive 

bias  and  synchronous  swimming  was  still  present  when  using  observational  data 

taken  in  the  two  months  prior  to  testing,  but  disappeared  when  going  two  to  four 

months  back  in  time.  Therefore  synchronous  swimming  frequency,  a  measure  of 

affiliative behaviour and social context (Connor et al., 2006a; Holobinko and Waring, 

2010; Kuczaj et al., 2013), is correlated with certain affective states which persist for 

a  few  weeks  or  months  (Mendl  et  al.,  2010;  Nettle  and  Bateson,  2012).  Further 

investigations  into  this  relationship  over  a  longer  period  of  time  are  needed  to 

illuminate  the  true  mechanisms  in  play.  As  social  animals  with  complex  group 

networks,  it  would  make  sense  adaptively  if  the  social  situation  and  resulting 

behaviours  did  indeed  influence  the  affective  states  of  dolphins.  There  are  a  few 

limitations with our results, including the fact that our moderate sample size may not 

have allowed us to detect all effects, and thus non-significant results must be treated 

with caution. Studies with higher sample sizes in a larger range of facilities would be 

valuable, as well as insight into the repeatability of cognitive biases. In general more 

work is needed on the occurrence of longer-term mood states in dolphins and other 

	

	
species, and cognitive bias testing such as that used here must start to fill the gaps 

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						90	

and stimulate future investigations. 

4.4. Conclusions 

We conducted the first cognitive bias tests in a zoo setting, and found that bottlenose 

dolphins  seem  to  show  differing  levels  of  “optimism”  in  captivity.  The  subjects’ 

cognitive biases were repeatable over several testing days, and the bias differences 

could be explained by the frequency of synchronous swimming observed outside the 

test sessions. To our knowledge, our results are the first to suggest empirically that 

higher  social  affiliation  in  animals  is  associated  with  positive  affective  states.  Since 

describing the causal relationship is out of our scope, we support the hypothesis that 

the performance of synchronous swimming either induced a certain affective state in 

the  dolphins,  and/or  was  induced  by  it.  Our  longer-term  data  showed  that  the 

relationship  between  synchronous  swimming  and  cognitive  bias  exists  two  months 

prior to testing but disappears after that, indicating that we have measured transitory 

affective states as opposed to stable behavioural traits. Synchronous swimming has 

been cited as a measure of affiliative behaviour and social bonding, and our results 

show that it is indeed likely to be associated with affective state. Further studies on 

such  behaviours  and  cognitive  biases  over  a  longer  timeframe  are  needed,  and 

which might also provide support for the tests’ use in measuring overall welfare.

Résumé 

Beaucoup  d'animaux  montrent  une  vigilance  et/ou  une  activité  accrue  par  rapport 

aux  événements  à  venir,  ces  comportements  sont  regroupés  sous  le  terme  de 

« comportement  anticipatoire ».  Le 

comportement  anticipatoire  à 

l’égard 

d’événements positifs a été proposé comme une mesure d'état affectif trans-espèce 

puisqu'il reflète probablement l'équilibre du « reward sensitivity system »: des études 

diverses  suggèrent  que  dans  des  situations  de  mal-être,  les  animaux  montrent  une 

anticipation  accrue  envers  des  événements  positifs  à  venir.  Un  autre  outil  pour 

évaluer l'état affectif des animaux sont les tests de biais cognitif, et bien qu'il ait été 

tenté,  aucun  lien  n'a  encore  été  fait  entre  le  biais  cognitif  et  des  niveaux  de 

comportement  anticipatoire.  En  captivité  les  grands  dauphins  (Tursiops  truncatus) 

produisent  plus  de  comportements  tels  que  ‘surface-looking’  et  ‘spy-hopping’  en 

attendant  des  sessions  de  dressage  aux  cours  desquelles  ils  vont  recevoir  de  la 

nourriture.  Les  tests  de  biais  cognitif  ont  été  récemment  appliqués  avec  succès  à 

cette  espèce  et  l'étude  actuelle  utilise  le  même  ensemble  de  données,  mais  inclut 

des données comportementales supplémentaires prises les jours de test à l'extérieur 

des  sessions  de  biais  cognitif,  pour  mesurer  la  fréquence  de  comportement 

anticipatoire  et  examiner  s'il  est  associé  aux  biais  cognitifs  des  dauphins.  Nous 

avons  trouvé  que  les  fréquences  les  plus  hautes  de  comportement  anticipatoire 

avant  des  sessions  étaient  significativement  associées  aux 

jugements  plus 

pessimistes  dans  des  tests  de  biais  cognitif,  ce  résultat  est  en  accord  avec  des 

découvertes  précédentes  liant  une  plus  haute  sensibilité  à  la  récompense    à  des 

états affectifs négatifs. D’autres études sont nécessaires pour déterminer le seuil de 

comportement anticipatoire au-dessus duquel l'état affectif est probablement négatif 

et  le  seuil  au-dessous  duquel  l'animal  anticipe  positivement  l'événement.  Le 

comportement  anticipatoire  est  une  activité  facilement  mesurable  qui  pourrait 

représenter  un  indicateur  de  bien-être  pour  des  dauphins  ainsi  que  pour  d'autres 

animaux dans des environnements captifs.

Abstract 

Many  animals  display  a  suite  of  increased  vigilance  and/or  activity  responses  in 

relation  to  upcoming  events,  termed  ‘anticipatory  behavior’.  Anticipatory  behavior 

towards positive events has been suggested as a cross-species measure of affective 

state  since  it  likely  reflects  the  balance  of  the  reward-sensitivity  system:  various 

studies suggest that animals in poorer welfare situations show increased anticipation 

for  positive  events.  Another  tool  for  evaluating  animals’  affective  state  is  cognitive 

bias  testing,  and  although  it  has  been  attempted,  a  link  has  not  yet  been  made 

between  cognitive  bias  and  anticipatory  behavior  levels.  Bottlenose  dolphins 

(Tursiops  truncatus)  in  captivity  increase  the  performance  of  behaviors  such  as 

surface-looking  and  spy-hopping  in  anticipation  of  training  sessions  during  which 

food  is  provided.  Cognitive  bias  testing  was  recently  applied  with  success  to  this 

species,  and  the  current  study  uses  the  same  dataset  but  includes  additional 

behavioral  data  taken  on  the  testing  days  but  outside  of  cognitive  bias  sessions,  to 

measure  anticipatory  behavior  frequency  and  investigate  whether  it  is  associated 

with  dolphins’  cognitive  biases.  We  found  that  higher  frequencies  of  anticipatory 

behavior  for  training  sessions  was  significantly  associated  with  more  pessimistic 

judgements  in  cognitive  bias  tests,  agreeing  with  previous  findings  linking  higher 

reward sensitivity with negative affective states. Further work is needed to determine 

the threshold of anticipatory behavior above which negative affect is likely, and below 

which the animal is positively anticipating the event. Anticipatory behavior is an easily 

measured activity and could represent a welfare indicator in dolphins as well as other 

animals in captive environments.

Introduction 

Anticipatory  behavior  describes  the  activity  performed  by  an  individual  in 

expectation  of  an  upcoming  event  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001).  The  ability  to  anticipate 

predictable  events  extends  to  the  vast  majority  of  species,  and  so  far  anticipatory 

behavior  has  most  often  been  documented  as  increased  activity,  vigilance  and/or 

increased transitions from one behavior to another (van den Bos et al., 2003; van der 

Harst  et  al.,  2003a).  The  most  often  studied  anticipatory  behaviors  have  been  in 

relation  to  expected  food  events  (Mistlberger,  2009;  Storch  and  Weitz,  2009),  but 

anticipation  has  also  been  shown  towards  for  example  access  to  play  opportunities 

(Anderson  et  al.,  2015),  enriched  housing  (van  der  Harst  et  al.,  2003b),  sexual 

interactions  (van  der  Harst  et  al.,  2003b)  and  positive  human-animal  interactions 

(Krebs et al., 2017).  

Anticipatory behavior has recently garnered interest in animal welfare research 

(van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007;  Watters,  2014)  because  it  is  thought  to  reflect 

underlying  affective  states  (combinations  of  discrete  emotions  Mendl  et  al.  2010), 

through its links with the reward sensitivity system (Spruijt et al., 2001; van der Harst 

and  Spruijt,  2007).  A  handful  of  studies  have  demonstrated  that  animals  in  poorer 

welfare conditions show a significantly higher level of anticipation to positive events 

than conspecifics in better welfare conditions (e.g. laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus, 

in  standard  versus  enriched  cages,  van  der  Harst  et  al.,  2003a,  2003b);  or  social 

isolation  versus  group  housing  (van  den  Berg  et  al.,  1999).  Animals  experiencing 

negative affective states place more “incentive value” on acquiring positive rewards, 

and thus anticipate their arrival more intensely (e.g. a hungrier animal will place more 

incentive  value  on  a  food  item)  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001).  However  the  link  between 

anticipatory behavior and affective state does not seem to be a straightforward linear 

relationship:  farmed  silver  foxes  (Vulpes  vulpes)  increased  anticipatory  as  well  as 

stereotypical  behaviors  before  a  positive  reward,  but  did  not  show  stereotypical 

behaviors  before  negative  events  (Moe  et  al.,  2006),  while  rats  in  depressed-like 

states did not anticipate positive rewards at all (von Frijtag et al., 2000). More work 

on this topic is necessary to understand the underlying motivational systems, and a 

recently published paradigm (adapted from van der Harst and Spruijt 2007) provides 

some direction: it predicts that the intensity of anticipatory behavior will increase with 

poorer welfare up to a point where the animal has entered chronic stress, after which 

it drops dramatically (Watters, 2014). 

In  parallel  to  anticipatory  behavior  being  proposed  as  a  welfare  measurement 

tool  (van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007),  another  approach  under  investigation  is 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						95	

	
cognitive  bias  testing  (Mendl  et  al.,  2009;  Wichman  et  al.,  2012).  Cognitive  biases 

reflect the effect of emotions on an individual’s cognitive functioning, and numerous 

tests  with  a  wide  range  of  species  have  shown  in  general  that  animals  in  poorer 

welfare  conditions  will  judge  ambiguous  cues  more  pessimistically,  and  vice  versa 

(latest  reviews  by  Baciadonna  and  McElligott,  2015;  Roelofs  et  al.,  2016).  Recent 

evidence  supports  a  link  between  affiliative  social  behavior  and  biases:  a  study  on 

canaries  (Serinus  canaria)  found  pair-housing  led  to  more  optimistic  judgements 

(Lalot et al., 2017), and bottlenose dolphins conducting more synchronous swimming 

in  their  free-time  also  judged  more  optimistically  (Clegg  et  al.,  2017a).  One  study 

(with laying hens, Gallus gallus domesticus) aimed to correlate anticipatory behavior 

frequency  to  cognitive  bias  but  found  no  associations,  however  they  recommended 

further  attempts  be  conducted  to  try  and  relate  these  two  potential  welfare  tests 

(Wichman et al., 2012). 

In order to examine the potential links between anticipatory behavior frequency 

and  cognitive  bias,  we  analyzed  further  the  behavioral  data  from  Clegg  and  co-

authors’ study (Clegg et al., 2017a [Paper 3, Chapter 3]) by measuring the frequency 

of  anticipatory  behaviors  of  captive  bottlenose  dolphins  towards  the  upcoming 

training sessions. In general it is thought that dolphins view the multiple, daily training 

sessions  positively  as  opposed  to  negatively,  due  to  the  anticipatory  behaviors 

towards  them  demonstrated  in  previous  studies  (Clegg  et  al.,  2017b;  Jensen  et  al., 

2013), the fact that the sessions constitute the provision of food, and their potential 

for  cognitive  stimulation  (Brando,  2010;  Laule  et  al.,  2003;  Miller  et  al.,  2011b). 

Therefore  we  hypothesized  that  in  accordance  with  the  reward-sensitivity  theory 

(Spruijt  et  al.,  2001),  those  dolphins  showing  the  higher  frequencies  of  anticipatory 

behavior would also make more pessimistic judgements in the cognitive bias task.  

 

Materials And Methods 

For the full methodology, equipment and test protocols please refer to Clegg and co-

authors’  study  (Clegg,  et  al.,  2017a;  [Paper  3,  Chapter  3]).  Short,  summarized 

descriptions, and any precisions in this study’s approach, are given below.  

1. Study Animals and Facility 

Eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) housed at Parc Astérix 

(Plailly, France) were used in this study (4 males, 4 females, age range: 4-43 years). 

The  dolphins  participated  in  multiple  daily  training  sessions,  which  could  involve 

tasks  conditioned  using  positive  reinforcement  (Brando,  2010)  such  as  medical 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						96	

	
training,  show  practice,  novel  behaviors,  free-feeds,  and  play  sessions.  During  the 

experiment,  almost  all  training  sessions  began  with  the  trainers  approaching  the 

outside beach area, and the start time did not vary by more than half an hour, with 

the intervals in-between sessions varying very little. Furthermore, acoustic and visual 

environmental  cues  (e.g.  trainers  preparing  and  setting  up  the  food  buckets)  were 

accessible  to  the  animals  for  distinguishing  the  start  time  of  the  upcoming  training 

session (as with other zoo animals’ anticipatory behavior; Krebs et al., 2017; Watters, 

2014). Since this management practice had been in place for the last several years, 

the  dolphins  had  been  conditioned  to  cues  signalling  the  imminent  start  of  training 

sessions.  Fixed  feeding  schedules  and  predictable  environmental  cues  have  been 

shown  to  elicit  anticipatory  behavior  in  many  species  in  zoo  and  other  captive 

settings  (Krebs  et  al.,  2017),  and  such  classical  conditioning  has  also  been 

deliberately  applied  in  other  anticipatory  behavior  studies  i.e.  pairing  experimental 

cues to rewards (e.g. Wichman et al. 2012). The park was closed to the public for the 

duration of the experiment. 

2. Cognitive bias testing 

2.1 Test protocol: judgement bias task from Clegg et al. 2017a [Paper 3, Chapter 3] 

Individual cognitive biases were measured using a spatial judgement Go/Go 

task adapted by Clegg and co-authors (Clegg et al., 2017a). A three-step procedure 

was designed with conservative criteria that had to be fulfilled in order to pass to the 

next  stage:  first  the  animals  were  taught  the  task  behavior,  which  was  to  touch  a 

target on the other side of the pool and return to the trainer. Once the animal touched 

the  target  with  their  rostrum,  a  whistle  (“bridge”)  was  blown  by  the  target-holder 

which  indicated  to  that  the  correct  behavior  had  been  performed  and  they  should 

return to the trainer. In Step 2, repeated trials were conducted where the target was 

placed  on  either  of  the  extreme  positions  (far  left  or  right  of  an  arc,  see  Fig.  1  in 

Clegg  et  al.,  2017a),  which  were  differentially  rewarded  with  either  a  herring, 

applause and rubs (the “Positive” (P) cue reward) or only applause and eye contact 

(the “Less-positive” (LP) cue reward). The animal care staff at Parc Astérix confirmed 

that  all  dolphins  would  view  the  Positive  and  the  Less-positive  rewards  as 

representing larger and smaller reinforcement respectively. Herring is larger and has 

a  higher  fat  content  than  the  other  types  of  fish  fed  at  Parc  Astérix  (Fisher  et  al., 

1992),  and  while  the  dolphins  react  positively  (by  approaching  and  contacting 

trainers) to applause and eye contact, this is considered a secondary reinforcement 

whereas  food  items  are  stronger,  primary  reinforcers  (Brando,  2010;  Neto  et  al., 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						97	

	
2016).  The  animals  were  not  separated  from  their  regular  social  groups  during 

testing  (advantages  discussed  in  (Roelofs  et  al.,  2016)),  in  order  to  avoid  inducing 

stress  from  social  isolation,  which  has  often  been  recorded  with  dolphins  (e.g. 

Waples & Gales, 2002). 

 

Once consistent differences in speed were seen (criteria: ≥ 2s faster to return 

from the Positive than the Less-positive cue), the animal progressed to Step 3, where 

the ambiguous cues were presented: the target was placed at three points along an 

arc  shape  between  the  Positive  and  Less-Positive  positions.  The  ambiguous  cue 

positions were termed Near-positive (NP), Middle (M), and Near-less-positive (NLP), 

and were equidistant from the start/finish position of the animal, and from each other. 

Within  Step  3,  each  animal  completed  three  sets  of  testing,  with  12  trials  in  each, 

conducted on three consecutive days. In each set of trials each ambiguous cue was 

presented once, following a pseudorandom order where a maximum of two positively 

(i.e. P) or less-positively reinforced cue positions (i.e. NP, M, NLP, LP) could follow 

one another. The reward given when the target was at the ambiguous positions was 

applause  and  eye  contact,  and  the  fact  that  the  whistle  was  blown  when  the  target 

was touched continued to let the animal know it had performed the correct behavior 

(Laule et al., 2003). The return times to the trainer from each of the ambiguous cues 

were  used  as  measures  of  cognitive  bias.  The  full  tests  were  completed  by  each 

animal during January and February 2016, and the fact that all animals progressed to 

Step  3  (i.e.  showed  ≥  2s  difference  between  the  Positive  and  Less-positive  cue) 

validated our choice of reinforcement for these two extreme cues.  

  

2.2 Cognitive bias response variables  

The  overall  response  variable  reflecting  cognitive  bias  was  the  dolphins’ 

return latency (in s) from the target to the trainer, where it would receive the reward 

(the  same  as  in  Clegg  et  al.,  2017a,  and  measured  from  video  footage).  For  the 

current  study,  the  return  latencies  of  each  dolphin  were  averaged  for  each  of  the 

Near-positive,  Middle  and  Near-negative  cues  (instead  of  taking  an  average  of  all 

three ambiguous cues as in Clegg et al., 2017a). This approach was chosen to fully 

investigate  any  associations  between  our  one  behavior  variable  (as  opposed  to 

multiple behaviors tested in Clegg et al., 2017a) and cognitive bias. If correlations are 

present it would be fruitful to be able to see whether they are conserved among the 

different  ambiguous  cues,  yielding  as  much  information  as  possible  on  the  link 

between  cognitive  bias  and  anticipatory  behavior  since  it  is  clearly  a  species-

independent topic of interest (Wichman et al., 2012). 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						98	

For  each  of  the  three  ambiguous  cues,  the  final  response  variable,  (as  in 

Clegg  et  al.,  2017a),  was  the  percentage  deviation  of  the  ambiguous  cue  average 

return  latency  from  the  individual’s  average  return  latency  from  the  Positive  and 

Less-positive  (conditioned)  cues.  This  allowed  us  to  control  for  the  different  swim 

speeds  of  the  dolphins,  and  produced  a  measure  of  individual  response  to  each 

ambiguous cues relative to the conditioned ones. 

3. Behavioral data collection 

During  the  3  days  when  the  final  cognitive  bias  tests  took  place  for  each 

animal, behavioral data was also taken during their “free-time” in order to assess the 

level of anticipatory behavior. Focal observations of 5 minutes with scan sampling for 

behaviors every 15s (Mann, 1999) were conducted once a day within the 15-minute 

period  before  one  of  the  five  main  training  sessions  (between  10:00  and  16:30),  in 

order  to  capture  an  accurate  reflection  of  anticipation  for  these  events  specifically. 

These  training  sessions  could  either  include  the  cognitive  bias  testing  or  not  (see 

description  of  training  sessions  earlier  in  the  methodology),  but  these  were 

conducted at random times of the day and there was no way for the animal to discern 

the contents of the session before it started, they were only able to predict the start 

time  using  environmental  and  time-delay  cues.  The  same  person  (IC)  always 

conducted the observations using a behavioral repertoire of the two most commonly 

described  anticipatory  behaviors  in  the  literature  (Clegg  et  al.,  2017b;  Miller  et  al., 

2011b):  surface-looking  and  spy-hopping  (Table  4).  Both  of    these  behaviors  were 

found  to  be  among  those  that  increased  before  training  sessions  in  two  previous 

studies  at  Parc  Astérix  (Clegg  et  al.,  2017b;  Jensen  et  al.,  2013).  For  analysis,  the 

scans  of  both  anticipatory  behaviors  were  summed  and  then  converted  to  a 

percentage of total scans per observation (i.e. to correct for non-visible scans), and 

are therefore described as frequencies hereafter.

Description 

 

Anticipatory 
behavior 

Surface look 

Dolphin lifts head out of the water while swimming, or head is held fixed while 
floating  stationary,  with  an  eye/eyes  directed  towards  a  point  above  the 
surface where a predictable event usually commences. A surface look can be 
distinguished  from  simply  taking  a  breath  by  the  fact  that  in  the  former,  the 
head  may  be  momentarily  suspended  above  the  water,  where  the  eyes  are 
clearly focussing above the water surface line. 

Spy hop 

Dolphin  propels  itself  vertically  out  of  the  water  with  the  eyes  directed  to  a 
point above the water’s surface, usually as far as the pectoral fins, and then 
descends vertically. Often repeats this several times consecutively. 

4. Data Analysis  

Statistical  analyses  were  done  with  R,  version  3.1.1  (R  Development  Core 

Team,  2016).  To  test  the  associations  between  cognitive  bias  test  results  and 

anticipatory  behavior  frequency,  we  used  linear  regression  models.  P-values  were 

calculated by Monte Carlo sampling with 10,000 permutations, using the R package 

pgirmess  (Giraudoux,  2016).  Such  permutation  tests  are  especially  appropriate  for 

moderate  sample  sizes  and  do  not  have  any  assumptions  regarding  normal 

distribution  of  residuals  (Good,  2005).  The  anticipatory  behavior 

frequency 

represented  the  independent  variable  in  three  separate  models  with  the  relative 

return  latency  for  the  NP,  M  and  NLP  ambiguous  cues  as  the  response  variable  in 

each. The Bonferroni correction was not applied to P-values because it was felt that 

the three variables, i.e. the three ambiguous cues NP, M and NLP, were measuring a 

facet of the same phenomenon and thus not truly independent (the correction should 

be  applied  when  the  “variables  being  tested  are  independent”,  Garcia,  2004).  We 

also  used  linear  models  and  permutation  tests  to  investigate  whether  anticipatory 

behavior frequencies and relative return latencies from each ambiguous cue differed 

with the sex of the animals (included as a factor in each model).

Results 

Absolute return latencies for all cues 

A  descriptive  graph  showing  the  absolute  return  latencies  for  each  dolphin 

over all the cues in the final testing phase (Fig. 8) allows us to verify that the animals 

maintained their differentiation between the conditioned cues (P and LP, on average 

2.0s  difference,  Clegg  et  al.,  2017a).  We  can  also  see  that  in  general  the  latencies 

for  all  dolphins  increase  incrementally  as  we  move  from  further  away  from  the 

Positive and closer to the Less-positive position.   

Fig.  8  Individual  dolphins’  absolute  latencies  (in  s)  to  return  from  the  conditioned 

(Positive  and  Less-positive)  and  ambiguous  (Near-positive,  Middle,  Near-less-

positive) cues. Labels on the right hand side indicate the sex (M/F) and age of each 

of the 8 dolphins. When all animals’ data were averaged, the latency to return from 

the  Positive  versus  the  Less-positive  cue  was  2.0  seconds  (min:  1.5  s,  max:  2.4  s) 

(Clegg et al., 2017a), demonstrating that the dolphins had continued to differentiate 

between the two conditioned cues.

Association between anticipatory behavior and ambiguous cue return latencies 

 

There  was  a  positive,  significant  correlation  between  anticipatory  behavior 

frequency  and  the  relative  return  latency  from  the  Near-positive  cue  (linear 
regression with 10,000 permutations: R2 = 0.593, P = 0.034; Fig. 9a), and a similar, 

although non-significant, tendency with respect to return latency from the Middle cue 
(R2  =  0.410,  P  =  0.087;  Fig.  9b).  Those  animals  performing  more  anticipatory 

behavior also returned slower from the ambiguous cues i.e. made more pessimistic 

decisions.  However,  there  was  no  significant  correlation  between  anticipatory 
behavior frequency and return latency from the Near-negative cue (R2 = 0.023, P = 

0.749).  

There  were  no  significant  differences  between  males  and  females  with 

respect to the frequency of anticipatory behavior, nor their return latencies from the 

Near-positive, Middle or Near-less-positive cues (all P > 0.05).  

Fig. 9 Cognitive bias test results predicted by anticipatory behavior. (a) The dolphins’ 

relative return latencies to the Near-positive cue were predicted by the frequency of 

anticipatory behavior toward the training sessions during the 3-day test period: those 

slowest  to  return  (pessimistic-like  judgement)  also  showed  significantly  highest 

frequencies of anticipatory behavior, and this same relationship was present (b) with 

respect  to  the  Middle  cue,  although  the  association  was  a  statistical  tendency  only. 

Note that high and positive y-axis values correspond to an optimistic-like judgement, 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						102	

	
and  the  lower  and  negative  to  pessimistic-like  judgements.  See  text  for  details  on 

statistics.  Anticipatory  behavior  in  relation  to  upcoming  training  sessions  was  the 

combined frequencies of two behaviors, surface-looking and spy-hopping (see Table 

4 for definitions).   

 

 

Discussion 

We  found  that  the  frequency  of  anticipatory  behavior  towards  upcoming 

training  sessions  predicted  cognitive  bias  in  bottlenose  dolphins.  Dolphins  showing 

the  higher  frequencies  of  anticipatory  behavior  also  made  more  pessimistic 

judgements in relation to the Near-positive ambiguous cue, and tended towards the 

same association for the Middle cue.   

Our  findings  are  the  first  to  provide  evidence  for  a  link  between  anticipatory 

behavior  and  cognitive  bias  in  any  species,  both  of  which  have  been  proposed  as 

tools  to  measure  animals’  affective  states  and  thus  having  implications  for  welfare 

(Mendl et al., 2009; van der Harst and Spruijt, 2007). A recent study with laying hens 

predicted  that  results  of  cognitive  bias  and  anticipatory  behavior  tests  would  be 

related,  but  were  not  able  to  prove  this  (Wichman  et  al.,  2012).  Here,  increased 

anticipatory  behavior  was  associated  with  longer  return  times  i.e.  more  pessimistic 

judgements:  significantly  for  the  Near-positive  ambiguous  cue,  a  tendency  for  the 

Middle  cue,  but  not  for  the  Near-less-positive  position.  This  discrepancy  between 

cues  is  congruous  to  previous  cognitive  bias  animal  studies,  where  focus  is  placed 

on  any  significant  result  found  among  the  ambiguous  cues:  the  difference  between 

results from each ambiguous cue is thus far unclear (Mendl et al., 2009; Salmeto et 

al., 2011). 

 

The  direction  of  our  results  agrees  with  our  hypothesis:  those  dolphins  that 

anticipated  the  training  sessions  more  also  had  more  pessimistic  cognitive  biases, 

which  have  been  associated  with  negative  affective  states  in  many  species 

(Baciadonna  and  McElligott,  2015;  Mendl  et  al.,  2009;  Roelofs  et  al.,  2016). 

According  to  the  reward-sensitivity  theory,  the  dolphins  experiencing  more  negative 

affective  states  (as  indicated  by  the  pessimistic  bias)  increase  their  anticipatory 

behavior  for  positive  events  because  they  place  a  higher  value  on  the  reward  to 

come, i.e. they desire it more, perhaps due to a lack of other positive events in their 

environment  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001).  Conversely,  the  dolphins  that  made  more 

optimistic  judgements  may  have  been  in  more  positive  affective  states,  and  thus 

were  less  sensitive  to  the  upcoming  reward  and  anticipated  it  less.  However,  as 

 

 

	

Chapter	3:	Cognitive	bias	testing						103	

	
discussed in the previous paper on this dataset  (Clegg et al., 2017a), the design of 

the study means that causal relationships between the behaviors and affective states 

represented  by  the  cognitive  bias  results  can  not  be  confirmed.  Another  alternative 

hypothesis  is  that  even  though  the  literature  regarding  dolphins  and  other  species 

suggests  otherwise,  it  could  be  that  the  dolphins  judging  pessimistically  and  who 

were potentially in more negative affective states in fact anticipated and viewed the 

feeding/training  sessions  as  negative  events  (Frohoff  and  Packard,  1995)  (but  note 

that  the  reward-sensitivity  theory  does  not  apply  to  negative  events,  Spruijt  et  al. 

2001). Although anticipatory behavior of captive dolphins is still a very new research 

area,  current  evidence  suggests  that  we  might  reject  this  alternative  hypothesis: 

firstly,  it  has  been  shown  with  other  species  that  the  type  of  anticipatory  behavior 

differs  in  response  to  upcoming  positive  versus  negative  events  (e.g.  Moe  et  al. 

2006;  Zimmerman  et  al.  2011).  Therefore  if  some  dolphins  were  anticipating  the 

training sessions in a negative light, we would not have likely seen such a convincing 

and  significant  association  since  the  anticipatory  behaviors  measured  would  have 

likely  been  different  types  (e.g.  those  with  links  to  fear  or  frustration,  as  with  hens, 

Zimmerman  et  al.,  2011).  Finally,  there  is  some  evidence  from  measures  of 

physiological  stress  during  or  after  training/show/guest  interaction  sessions:  the 

breathing  rate  (St.  Aubin  and  Dierauf,  2001)  of  bottlenose  dolphins  did  not  differ 

between the periods before and after show sessions (Jensen et al., 2013), and three 

stress  hormones  of  belugas  (Delphinapterus  leucas)  did  not  change  from  baseline 

levels during guest interaction sessions (Schmitt et al., 2010).  

 

The  anticipatory  behaviors  of  captive  dolphins  studied  here,  surface  looking 

and  spy-hopping,  are  direct  products  of  the  environment  and  management  of 

humans  since  the  animals  are  using  cues  to  prepare  for  an  event  that  will  occur  in 

the near future (Jensen et al., 2013). Therefore, it is hard to make comparisons with 

any  potential  anticipatory  behaviors  in  wild  dolphin  populations,  since  the  context, 

cues  and  rewards  are  completely  different.  Further  investigations  with  controlled 

variation  of  these  components  would  help  us  to  better  understand  anticipatory 

behaviors, as well as for example basic experiments with captive animals to discover 

whether increased anticipatory behavior means the animal is more motivated for the 

reward i.e. do anticipation levels predict behavior during the reward’s acquisition? It 

could  be  that  animals  that  strongly  anticipate  a  positive  reward,  but  once  it  arrives 

are  not  motivated  to  exploit  it,  are  in  poorer  welfare  than  animals  who  highly 

anticipate  the  reward  and  then  actively  exploit  it  (perhaps  similar  to  a  stereotypy, 

since  there  would  appear  to  be  no  function  to  the  behavior,  Mason  and  Rushen,

2008). Our study has shed some light on the frequencies of anticipatory behavior in 

captive dolphins which might be linked to positive and negative affective states, and 

thus  could  start  to  fill  in  the  gaps  for  this  species  (i.e.  thresholds  on  the  proposed 

models:  van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007;  Watters,  2014).  However  our  work  is  only 

the first step and used a moderate sample size of animals: more work is needed on 

multiple  groups  to  uncover  the  real  significance  and  utility  of  anticipatory  behavior 

measurement in captive bottlenose dolphins.

Résumé 	

Le  comportement  anticipatoire  décrit  les  actions  prises  pour  se  préparer  à  un 

événement à venir. Des grands dauphins (Tursiops truncatus) en captivité montrent 

des  comportements  anticipatoires  avant  des  sessions  alimentaires,  mais  nous 

ignorons  s'ils  vont  anticiper  des  événements  non-alimentaires.  En  outre,  il  n'y  a 

aucune  information  publiée  disponible  sur  n'importe  quelle  espèce  pour  savoir  si  le 

niveau de comportement anticipatoire est lié à la participation réelle d'un animal dans 

l'événement suivant ou à la récompense : répondre à cette question nous aiderait à  

comprendre ce comportement et les états affectifs qui lui sont liés. Dans cette étude, 

nous avons utilisé des signaux sonores pour conditionner des dauphins à l'arrivée de 

jouets  dans  leur  bassin  ou  d’une  Interaction  Humain-Animal  positive  (HAI)  avec  un 

soigneur  familier  et  nous  avons  mesuré  leur  comportement  anticipatoire  avant 

chaque  événement.  Le  protocole  a  été  validé  lorsque  les  dauphins  ont  montré 

significativement plus de comportement anticipatoire avant l’arrivée des jouets et de 

l’HAI que lors dune situation contrôle, des fréquences accrues de ‘surface-looking’ et 

‘spy-hopping’  ont  été  mesurées.  En  outre,  nous  avons  trouvé  que  les  dauphins  ont 

montré  plus  de  comportement  anticipatoire  avant  l’HAI  que  lors  du  contexte  de 

jouets. Dans la deuxième partie de l’étude, le comportement anticipatoire plus élévé 

avant 

l’introduction  de 

jouets, 

l’HAI  et  des  sessions  alimentaires  étaient 

significativement corrélées aux niveaux les plus hauts de participation à l’évènement 

lui-même (mesuré par le temps passé avec des humains/jouets et le nombre de fois 

que  les  dauphins  ont  quitté  les  soigneurs  pendant  des  sessions  alimentaires).  Nos 

résultats  suggèrent  que  les  jouets  et  l’HAI  ont  été  perçus  comme  des  événements 

positifs  par  les  dauphins,  et  nous  proposons  que  des  interactions  humaines  non-

alimentaires  jouent  un  rôle  important  dans  la  vie  de  ces  animaux.  Nous  apportons 

aussi la première preuve empirique que le comportement anticipatoire est corrélé au 

niveau  de  participation  à  l'événement  suivant,  soutenant  que  le  comportement 

anticipatoire  est  une  mesure  de  motivation,  et  nous  espérons  que  ce  résultat 

stimulera  de  nouveaux  travaux  sur  l'utilisation  de  ce  comportement  pour  évaluer  et 

améliorer le bien-être animal.

Abstract	

Anticipatory behaviour describes the actions taken to prepare for an upcoming event. 

Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in captivity are known to display anticipatory 

behaviours before feeding sessions, but it is unknown whether they would anticipate 

non-alimentary  events.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  published  information  available  for 

any species on whether the level of anticipatory behaviour is predictive of an animal’s 

actual  participation  in  the  following  event  or  reward:  answering  this  question  would 

bring us closer to understanding this behaviour and its related affective states. In this 

study, we used sound cues to condition dolphins to the arrival of toys in their pool or 

a positive Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) with a familiar trainer, and measured their 

anticipatory  behaviour  before  each  event.  The  protocol  was  validated  since  the 

dolphins performed significantly more anticipatory behaviour before the toys and HAI 

contexts  than  a  control  situation,  by  means  of  increased  frequencies  of  surface 

looking  and  spy  hopping.  Furthermore,  we  found  that  dolphins  showed  more 

anticipatory behaviour before the HAI than the toys context. In the second part of the 

investigation,  higher  anticipatory  behaviour  before  toy  provision,  HAIs,  and  feeding 

sessions was significantly correlated to higher levels of participation in the event itself 

(measured by time spent with humans/toys, and number of times dolphins left during 

feeding  sessions).  Our  results  suggest  that  toys  and  HAIs  were  perceived  as 

rewarding  events,  and  we  propose  that  non-food  human  interactions  play  an 

important  role  in  these  animals’  lives.  We  also  provide  the  first  empirical  evidence 

that  anticipatory  behaviour  is  correlated  to  the  level  of  participation  in  the  following 

event,  supporting  anticipatory  behaviour  as  a  measure  of  motivation,  and  hope  that 

this  stimulates  further  work  regarding  the  use  of  this  behaviour  to  assess  and 

improve animal welfare.

1.Introduction 

 

Anticipatory behaviour performed in expectation of predictable events is well-

documented  in  wild  and  captive  animals,  and  consists  of  behavioural  patterns  that 

prepare the animal for the upcoming situation (Spruijt et al., 2001). Such anticipatory 

behaviours  often  manifest  as  increased  activity,  vigilance,  and/or  behavioural 

transitions (Makowska and Weary, 2016; van den Bos et al., 2003; van der Harst et 

al.,  2003a).  Studies  on  anticipatory  behaviour  have  revealed  links  with  captive 

animals’  affective  states,  and  thus  suggest  implications  for  welfare  (see  reviews  by 

Van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007;  Watters,  2014).  However,  although  resource 

provision  in  captive  environments  is  often  highly  predictable  and  thus  anticipatory 

behaviour  is  nearly  always  present  and  obvious  (Waitt  and  Buchanan-Smith,  2001; 

Watters,  2014),  there  is  still  a  lack  of  knowledge  on  how  anticipatory  behaviour 

reflects animals’ motivational and affective states. 

 

Anticipatory  behaviour  towards  a  positive  event  is  adaptive  since  it  is 

associated  with  the  motivational  system  that  directs  the  animal  from  an  aversive 

state (e.g. hungry) to a reinforcing state (e.g. food acquisition; see Spruijt et al. 2001, 

for  full  explanation).  Animals  use  a  variety  of  environmental  cues  to  predict  when 

rewards will become available and thus make a contingent associations between the 

cue  and  following  event  (Anderson  et  al.,  2015):  such  contingencies  can  also  be 

experimentally  induced  using  the  Pavlovian  paradigm  to  measure  anticipatory 

behaviour. The link between this behaviour and affective states is not linear however, 

since anticipation levels have been found to vary with reward sensitivity. Again, this 

is adaptive: a more food-deprived animal is in a more negative affective state where 

the  reward  (food)  will  have  a  higher  value,  and  thus  more  anticipatory  behaviour  is 

performed (termed "incentive value" by Spruijt et al., 2001).  

 

Thus far, anticipatory behaviour has principally been used to test whether an 

animal  perceives  a  certain  predictable  event  as  a  reward  (or  not),  and  what  the 

current  affective  state  is  likely  to  be  based  on  the  anticipatory  behaviour  frequency 

(van der Harst and Spruijt, 2007). Anticipatory behaviour before food acquisition has 

been  extensively  studied  and  shown  to  be  robust  and  stable  over  multiple  cycles 

(Mistlberger, 2009; Storch and Weitz, 2009). Since anticipatory behaviour reflects a 

reward’s value (Anderson et al., 2015; van der Harst et al., 2003b), studies have also 

used  it  to  test  relative  values  placed  on  certain  non-alimentary  events,  in  multiple 

species:  for  example,  laboratory  rats  (Rattus  norvegicus)  anticipated  access  to 

sexual contact (van der Harst et al., 2003b); laying hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) 

valued a dusty substrate more than a food reward (McGrath et al., 2016); and lambs 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						110	

	
(Ovis aries) anticipated opportunities to play (Anderson et al., 2015). Environmental 

enrichment  seems  to  be  a  notable  context  that  stimulates  anticipation  in  various 

species (e.g. McGrath et al., 2016; van der Harst et al., 2003b), and such studies are 

applicable  to  improving  welfare  as  they  reveal  what  the  animal  “wants”  most  in  its 

environment (Dawkins, 2006). A few past studies with rats have successfully shown 

that  anticipatory  behaviour  can  predict  affective  states:  animals  in  more  enriched 

cages  conducted 

less  anticipatory  behaviour 

than 

those 

in  standard  cages 

(Makowska  and  Weary,  2016;  van  der  Harst  et  al.,  2003a),  and  those  who 

experienced social isolation anticipated food rewards and social contact significantly 

more than group-housed conspecifics (van den Berg et al., 1999).  

 

However,  these  are  the  first  studies  using  anticipatory  behaviour  as  a 

measure of affective state and there are still many unknowns (Watters, 2014). There 

seems  to  have  been  a  slight  overlook  in  regards  to  what  this  behaviour  is 

representing,  and  we  suggest  that  a  much  needed  line  of  research  is  whether  the 

levels  of  anticipation  actually  correspond  to  the  animal’s  participation  in  the  reward 

once it has access to it i.e. the consummation of the anticipated goal (Watters, 2014). 

For example, are the animals that show much anticipatory behaviour for enrichment 

provision also those that interact with the enrichment the most? A few studies have 

presented incidental data suggesting that this might be the case: for example some 

anticipatory  behaviours  were  correlated  in  lambs  with  subsequent  play  behaviour 

(but only at some points of the test, Anderson et al., 2015), and in laying hens with 

the latency to approach the reward (McGrath et al., 2016). However this question has 

not  yet  been  directly  posed  in  such  studies,  and  discovering  whether  frequency  of 

anticipatory  behaviour  predicts  interaction  with  the  reward  would  surely  be  a  step 

towards revealing the function of these behaviours.  

 

Bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  have  been  shown  to  display 

anticipatory  behaviour  in  response  to  training  sessions  during  which  they  receive 

their food (Clegg et al., 2017b; Jensen et al., 2013). Apart from food provision, there 

are  other  events  occurring  in  the  captive  environment  which  are  thought  to  be 

rewarding for dolphins, but for which there are only a few studies: all we know is that 

the animals will voluntarily interact with toys and other enrichment items and so seem 

to view them positively on the whole (Clark, 2013; Delfour and Beyer, 2012; Kuczaj 

et al., 2002). However, we have little to no knowledge on dolphins’ actual motivation 

or “want” for non-food enrichment events, and the literature suggests that measuring 

anticipatory  behaviour  could  help  in  answering  this  question,  which  is  of  interest  to 

researchers  and  managers  of  zoo  collections  alike  (Watters,  2014).  It  has  been 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						111	

	
suggested  that  positive  Human-Animal  Interactions  (HAIs),  e.g.  those  involving 

stroking,  play,  voluntary  contact,  might  also  be  rewarding  for  dolphins  like  they  are 

for  other  species  (Perelberg  and  Schuster,  2009).  Positive  HAIs  in  domesticated 

species  generally  incite  affiliation,  have  calming  effects,  and  stimulate  approach 

behaviour (e.g. Coulon et al., 2015; Handlin et al., 2011). Even for non-domesticated 

animals,  positive  HAIs  can  reduce  stress  (Hosey  and  Melfi,  2014;  Whitham  and 

Wielebnowski,  2013),  represent  gratifying  events  (Claxton,  2011;  Hosey,  2008)  and 

develop  into  strong,  welfare-enhancing  bonds  (Hosey  and  Melfi,  2010).  Wild  and 

captive  dolphins  frequently  engage  in  intra-specific  tactile  and  play  behaviour 

(Dudzinski  et  al.,  2012;  Kuczaj  et  al.,  2013),  which  could  tangibly  be  translated  to 

inter-specific  relations  (Perelberg  and  Schuster,  2009),  and  case-level  evidence 

suggests they can view humans as play partners or objects (review in Paulos et al., 

2010). Mixed results from studies on dolphins’ reactions to swim or touch interactions 

with  unfamiliar  guests  suggest  these  are  viewed  both  positively  and  negatively 

(Frohoff and Packard, 1995; Kyngdon et al., 2003; Trone et al., 2005). However, zoo 

animal  research  suggests  that  they  significantly  prefer  interactions  with  familiar 

humans  (Martin  and  Melfi,  2016;  Melfi  and  Thomas,  2005;  Mitchell  et  al.,  1991).  In 

the  only  study  on  HAIs  with  familiar  humans  and  captive  cetaceans,  it  was  shown 

that outside of food-related training sessions bottlenose dolphins voluntarily chose to 

receive  petting  from  their  trainers  in  seemingly  positive  interactions  (Perelberg  and 

Schuster,  2009).  However,  no  studies  have  used  anticipatory  behaviour 

measurement  as  a  means  to  determine  the  value  that  dolphins  or  other  species 

place  on  HAIs  with  familiar  humans.  Only  one  related  study  has  been  published 

previously,  using  case  studies  with  two  individual  zoo  animals,  where  anticipatory 

behaviour  increased  before  predictable  visual  HAIs  (no  contact)  with  an  unfamiliar 

human (Krebs et al., 2017). 

  

The  lack  of  knowledge  regarding  supposed  positive  events  for  captive 

dolphins in particular, coupled with the potential for anticipatory behaviour to answer 

this,  stimulated  a  study  to  be  conducted  on  the  bottlenose  dolphins  at  Parc  Astérix 

(Plailly,  France).  Two  main  questions  were  established:  1)  Does  the  dolphins’ 

anticipatory  behaviour  differ  in  relation  to  predictable  upcoming  contexts:  the 

provision of toys, an HAI with a familiar person, versus a control context? To test this, 

these events would be paired with different predictor cues signalling a certain event 

will occur; anticipatory behaviour duration in the period after the cues would then be 

measured.  We  predicted  that  dolphins  would  anticipate  the  toys  and  HAI  events 

significantly  more  that  the  control  context,  and  that  they  might  anticipate  toys  and 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						112	

	
HAIs  similarly.  The  second  question  addressed  an  as  yet  unanswered  element  of 

anticipatory behaviour research: 2) Is the duration of anticipatory behaviour before an 

event  correlated  with  dolphins’  level  of  participation  in  the  event  itself?  To  answer 

this,  anticipatory  behaviour  before  the  event  would  be  correlated  with  measures  of 

interaction during it i.e. with the toys or familiar humans, and also in a third context of 

food provision within positive reinforcement training sessions. Based on the literature 

discussed  above  the  provision  of  food,  toys,  and  positive  HAIs  were  thought  to  be 

rewarding  events  for  the  dolphins,  although  no  a  priori  assumptions  were  made 

which  might  have  influenced  our  experimental  design.  We  predicted  that  animals 

who anticipated the signalled events the most would also participate the most during 

the  event  itself:  if  confirmed,  these  results  could  validate  dolphins’  anticipatory 

behaviour  as  a  reflection  of  the  intrinsic  value  they  place  on  aspects  of  their 

environment.   

2. Material and methods 

2.1 Study animals and their daily routine 

Our  study  was  conducted  at  Parc  Astérix  on  a  group  of  seven  Atlantic 

bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), who were living in an outdoor pool joined to 
two indoor pools, with a total volume of 3790 m3 of water with continuous free access 

between  pools.  The  study  subjects  ranged  in  age  from  1.5  to  43  years  old  and 

consisted of 5 females: 4 adults and 1 juvenile, and 2 males: both adults (11 years or 

over,  age  classification  taken  from  Smolker  et  al.,  1992).  Not  all  animals  were 

related, and three were wild caught (the oldest) and four were captive born. The park 

was closed to the public for the duration of the experiment. The animals’ daily routine 

was structured through multiple “training sessions” where they received their food on 

a  positive  reinforcement  basis  (see  Laule  et  al.,  2003,  for  detailed  explanation), 

supplemented by free feeds as first and last sessions of the day (Table 5a). At least 

once  a  day  but  more  often  2  or  3 

times  (outside  of 

this  experiment’s 

implementations), both enrichment items and HAIs would be offered to the animals in 

their “free-time” between training sessions. The enrichment was provided three times 

a  day  (morning,  lunch-time  period,  and  afternoon;  Table  5a),  using  a  random 

selection from a list of about 40 objects ranging in size, material and buoyancy, and 

could  be  combined  with  water  jets  and  hoses.  HAIs  occurring  outside  this  study’s 

protocol were not planned as such: at random times throughout the day the dolphin 

trainers  would  approach  and  sit/stand  by  the  side  of  the  pool  and  interact  with  the 

dolphins  who  decide  to  approach.  These  spontaneous  HAIs  consisted  of  strokes,

cuddles, playing with water and toys, running back and forth, with the trainers using 

their hands, feet and voices.

and February 2017.

2.2 Question 1: differential anticipation of Control, Toy and HAI contexts? 

2.2.1 The cues (Unconditioned Stimuli, US)   

  

In order to measure the dolphins’ anticipation for the provision of toys and the 

opportunity  for  an  HAI,  we  needed  to  pair  these  contexts  with  cues  that  reliably 

signalled their imminent arrival. We also needed to include a Control context where a 

cue would signal the arrival of nothing i.e. no change in the environment, in order for 

us to verify that it was not simply the cues themselves that were causing anticipatory 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						114	

	
behaviour.  We  chose  to  use  sounds  as  the  principal  cues  because  this  is  a 

predominant and highly salient sense for dolphins (Janik, 2009), and included visual 

cues  as  supplementary  signals  to  be  sure  that  the  animals  could  distinguish  the 

upcoming  context,  in  case  they  had  for  some  reason  not  perceived  the  sound  cue 

(for  example  if  they  were  engaged  in  active  play  or  aggression  at  the  time  it  was 

played,  or  their  head  was  out  of  the  water).  During  the  experiment,  the  dolphins 

would have free access between the inside and outside pools, and sound cues would 

ensure that even if they happened to be inside and out of sight of the area where the 

cues  and  contexts  were  to  be  provided  (the  main  beach  area  of  the  outside  pool), 

they would still be able to hear the cues each time they were played.  

Three  different  sounds  were  needed  (to  pair  with  the  three  contexts)  which 

had  not  been  heard  before  by  the  dolphins,  and  we  synthesised  them  using  AVID 

Pro Tools software (Avid Technology, Inc., Burlington, MA, USA). In order to create 

unique,  non-aversive  sounds  which  were  not  completely  counter-intuitive  to  the 

dolphins, we referred to the literature: the acoustic repertoire of Tursiops truncatus is 

characterised by frequency-modulated vocalisations (Janik, 2009), and studies have 

shown  these  animals  are  able  to  successfully  pair  artificial  frequency-modulated 

sounds  with  objects  (Reiss  and  McCowan,  1993;  Richards  et  al.,  1984).  The  three 

sounds  created  for  this  experiment  (Fig.  10)  were  narrow-bandwidth,  frequency-

modulated signals, each having a duration of 2s, where the frequency was kept well-

within  reported  limits  of  this  species  (Janik,  2009).  The  sounds  were  played  to  the 

animals  using  a  Lubell  Lab  underwater  speaker  (Lubell  Labs  Inc.,  Columbus  OH, 

USA; LL916C, frequency response: 200 Hz–20 kHz) connected to a TAG Premio 8 

(Techniques  Audio  Groupe,  France)  via  an  AC203  transformer  box,  with  the  sound 

files  being  played  from  an  iPhone  SE  (Apple  Inc.,  Cupertino,  CA,  USA).  The 

underwater speaker was held at 50cm below the water’s surface at the edge of the 

pool  (always  in  the  same  place  on  the  main  beach  area),  and  each  sound  was 

repeated three times with a 1s pause in-between so that the total sequence for each 

sound type was around 8s in duration. In a preliminary test, using hydrophones, we 

verified  that  when  the  sound  was  played  from  the  outside  pool  beach  area,  it  was 

perceivable at all points of the inside pools.

Fig.  10  Spectrograms  (Raven  Lite  1.0,  Cornell  University,  NY,  USA)  of  the  three 

sound  cues  used  to  announce  the  three  different  contexts  which  were  presented 

after a 5 min delay; (a) was the sound for the Control context, (b) indicated the arrival 

of toys in the pool, and (c) signalled an Human-Animal Interaction (HAI). Recordings 

of these sounds were made using a CRT hydrophone C54XRS (frequency response: 

0.016–44 kHz ± 3 dB) plugged into a TASCAM HDP2 recorder (acquisition rate: 96 

kHz;  samples  coded  on  24  bits).  Fast  Fourier  transformation  =  1.024,  Hanning 

window, overlap = 50%.  

In  order  to  teach  the  dolphins  that  each  sound  signalled  the  arrival  of  a 

certain  context,  Pavlov’s  classical  conditioning  paradigm  was  used,  as  in  previous 

anticipatory  behaviour  studies  (e.g.  van  der  Harst  et  al.,  2003a;  Wichman  et  al., 

2012).  Before  any  conditioning  occurred,  the  Sound  Pressure  Level  (SPL)  of  the 

sounds  emitted  was  verified  in  case  it  might  be  aversive  to  the  dolphins,  who  had 

never  experienced  underwater  playback  experiments  before.  Based  on  established 

hearing thresholds for Tursiops truncatus (Johnson, 1967), and the reported SPLs of 

dolphin echolocation and whistling (Janik, 2009), the SPL of the sounds played from 

the  underwater  speakers  was  set  at  130  dB  re  1µPa.  A  few  habituation  trials  were 

conducted to get the dolphins used to the speaker playing sounds (using those of a 

similar type but not the same as the test sounds), after which there were no aversive 

or avoidance behaviours seen. Lastly, for each context and in addition to the sound 

cues,  we  also  placed  a  visual  cue-  a  laminated  piece  of  coloured  cardboard- 

vertically  on  the  main  beach  area  which  remained  visible  to  the  dolphins  for  the 

duration of each trial. For the Control context the cardboard positioned on the beach 

was  100%  black,  for  the  Toys  it  was  100%  white,  and  for  the  HAI  it  was  mid-grey 

(50% black) with white diagonal stripes. In the following methods description it should 

be assumed that references to presentation of “sound cues” refers simultaneously to 

these supplementary visual cues.

2.2.2 The contexts (Conditioned Stimuli, CS) 

For all trials (presentation of sound cues followed by a context) in each stage 

of the experiment, the context always occurred for a duration of 10 min, after which it 

was fully removed/terminated from the animals’ environment. 

A  trial  with  the  ‘Toys’  context  consisted  of  the  addition  of  seven  non-novel, 

floating  objects  which  differed  in  size,  shape  and  texture.  This  was  a  slightly  more 

limited  selection  of  enrichment  than  the  dolphins  received  in  their  normal  daily 

schedule  (Table  5a)  i.e.  no  sinking  objects  or  water  jets.  Toys  had  to  be  floating  to 

allow  accurate  measurement  of  the  interaction  duration  times,  and  all  toys  were 

removed  from  the  pool  at  the  end  of  the  trial.  Furthermore,  a  recent  study  on  the 

same group of dolphins has shown that dolphins played more with simple-floating, as 

opposed  to  complex-sinking,  objects  (Delfour  et  al.,  2017).  The  seven  toys  were 

selected in a pseudo-random fashion from a list of 40 where the same toy could not 

be selected for more than three consecutive days, in order to avoid a loss of interest 

in the toys for the dolphins. 

The  HAI  context  was  defined  as  a  familiar  trainer  (worked  with  the  dolphins 

for  ≥  2  years,  n  =  7)  approaching  the  pool  side  and  playing  with  the  dolphins.  This 

was  an  adaptation  of  the  farm  animal  Approach-Avoidance  tests  used  to  measure 

Human-Animal Relationships (Waiblinger et al., 2006), and suggested previously for 

assessing  dolphin  welfare  (Clegg  et  al.,  2015).  A  consensus-taking  session  with  all 

participating trainers occurred prior to the experiment in order to determine a number 

of  common  elements  of  a  Trainer-Dolphin  interaction  which  they  believed  the 

dolphins  seemed  to  enjoy  the  most.  Through  a  system  of  voting  rounds,  it  was 

decided that during the HAI context trials the trainers could interact with the dolphins 

using some or all of the following five elements: eye contact; strokes and rubs; use of 

the  voice;  use  of  hands  and  feet  (but  not  full  body)  in  water  for  tactile  interactions; 

moving  around  in  a  follow/chase-me  type  of  game.  We  standardised  the  HAIs  to  a 

certain  level  since  trainers  were  not  permitted:  to  leave  the  poolside  of  the  main 

beach  area  (arc  with  circumference  of  around  10m);  to  fully  enter  the  water;  to  use 

any hand signals resembling show cues; to use any toys, ice-cubes or other objects 

to play with the dolphins; to call the dolphins to the beach, for example by slapping 

the  water.  Therefore  in  any  given  HAI  trial,  the  trainer  would  present  themselves  at 

the pool’s side and interact with whichever dolphins decided to approach them, using 

the five pre-determined elements and refraining from any of the prohibited actions; at 

the end of the trial, they would simply leave the poolside and move out of sight. The 

	
 

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						117	

	
trainer who would take part in each trial was selected pseudo-randomly in that they 

could not be chosen for more than two consecutive trials.  

A  Control  context  trial  entailed  the  sound  cue  being  played  and  then 

nothing  in  the  environment  changing.  Throughout  the  experiment  for  all  of  the 

contexts,  no  external  events  were  allowed  to  take  place  around  the  poolside, 

including  but  not  limited  to:  staff  conducting  cleaning,  maintenance  work,  divers 

cleaning underwater, or any other toys or water jets in the pool. 

 

 

2.2.3 Measurement of anticipatory behaviour (Conditioned Response, CR) 

Using  previous  studies  documenting  anticipatory  behaviour,  we  defined  the 

two  main  behaviours  thought  to  indicate  dolphins’  anticipation  of  a  positive  event 

(Table  6).  Anticipatory  behaviour  was  the  CR  in  the  Pavlovian  paradigm,  and  thus 

was measured during the time after the sound cue (CS) was played and up until the 

selected  context  (US)  was  presented.  Video  footage  was  taken  with  a  GoPro® 

HERO 4 (GoPro, CA, USA) secured to a vantage point 5m above the surface of the 

water where all animals in the pool could be seen (apart from when they were in the 

inside  pool).  Employing  focal  individual  sampling,  the  duration  (in  s)  of  the  two 

defined behaviours was measured using the video footage and the response variable 

was the cumulative durations as a percentage of visible time.   

Table  6  Behavioural  repertoire  used  for  anticipatory  behaviour  data  collection 

(adapted from Clegg et al., 2017b; Jensen et al., 2013).  

Description 

 

Anticipatory 
behaviour 

Surface look 

The dolphin’s head is out of the water while swimming, or head is held 
fixed while floating stationary, and eyes are directed towards a point above 
the surface. A surface look can be distinguished from simply taking a 
breath by the fact the head may be momentarily suspended above the 
water, where the eyes are clearly above the surface line looking towards 
the area where the predictable event usually commences. 

The dolphin propels itself vertically out of the water with the eyes directed 
to a point above the water’s surface, usually as far as the pectoral fins, and 
then descends vertically. Often repeats this several times consecutively.

2.2.4 Sequence of trials  

Learning phase: Pairing sound cues (US) to contexts (CS)  

The learning phase took place over four weeks (November-December 2016) 

with two trials (sound cue and presentation of context) at set times every weekday. 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						118	

	
The  order  of  trials  was  a  fixed  consecutive  pattern  of  the  three  contexts  (Control, 

Toys  and  HAI).  In  the  trials  at  the  start  of  this  phase,  the  sound  cues  were  played 

and the context was presented immediately afterwards with no delay. Then, in small 

increments and over 34 trials, the time delay was increased gradually from 0 s to 5 

min (similar to previous anticipatory behaviour study protocols, e.g. Wichman et al., 

2012).  Once  this  stage  was  reached,  a  set  of  trials  (n  =  9,  three  repeats  of  each 

context) was conducted where the sound was played and 5 min later the context was 

presented,  and  additionally  the  anticipatory  behaviour  was  measured  during  the  5 

min  intermediate  period.  This  data  showed  that  on  average  over  all  individuals  and 

for  the  three  repeats,  the  dolphins  were  performing  anticipatory  behaviour  for  twice 

as long in the 5 min before the Toys and HAI context as before the Control context. 

This provided the evidence that they had successfully made the association between 

the CS and US, and thus the experiment advanced to the data collection phase. 

Data  collection  phase:  Measuring  the  anticipatory  behaviour  (Conditioned 

Response, CR) 

The data collection phase ran from mid-December 2016 until February 2017, 

and comprised of one trial per day (n = 47; 16 Control trials, 15 Toys, 16 HAI). Trials 

were  always  conducted  between  14:40  and  15:00  each  day,  since  the  previous 

training session finished at around 14:30 and the next did not start until 15:30, so this 

would  reduce  as  much  as  possible  the  potential  confounding  effect  of  anticipatory 

behaviour  occurrence  in  relation  to  the  training  sessions  (see  Table  5b).  The  delay 

between the sound cues and the arrival of the context remained fixed at 5 min, the 

context was always presented to the dolphins for 10 min, and the same person (IC) 

always played the sound cues and added the toys to the pool.  

2.3  Question  2:  link  between  anticipatory  behaviour  and  participation  in  upcoming 

event? 

2.3.1 Measuring the dolphins’ anticipatory behaviour 

Our  goal  was  to  compare  an  individual  dolphin’s  anticipation  with  the  extent 

that it participated in the event once it became available i.e. its level of interaction or 

motivation  during  the  event.  In  order  to  cover  a  range  of  events,  we  used  two  non-

food and one food situation: the animals being presented with Toys, the opportunity 

for an HAI, or receiving food rewards within a training session (hereafter referred to 

as “feeding session”). The first element needed to answer this question was data on 

the  level  of  anticipatory  behaviour  before  the  event  appeared.  For  the  contexts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						119	

	
represented  by  Toys  and  HAI,  the  protocol  conducted  for  Question  1  (described  in 

section  2.2.3)  was  also  used  here:  Pavlovian  conditioning  trials  allowed  the 

anticipatory  behaviour  to  be  recorded  after  the  sound  cue  and  in  the  5  minutes 

before  the  context  arrived.  Concerning  the  animals’  anticipation  of  the  feeding 

session  context,  inadvertent  classical  conditioning  had  taken  place  over  several 

years  due  to  the  fixed  feeding  schedules  and  multiple  cues  signalling  the  start  of 

sessions  (common  in  zoo  environments,  Krebs  et  al.,  2017).  The  dolphins  were 

engaged in five feeding sessions each day during which they participated in medical 

training,  show  practice,  novel  behaviours,  research  tasks,  and  play  sessions,  all 

conducted  by  the  trainers  and  using  positive  reinforcement  techniques  (as  well  as 

two  “free-feeds”  at  start  and  finish  of  the  day)  (Table  5).  During  this  study  and  for 

several years before, feeding sessions almost always began by the trainers walking 

out  to  the  main  beach  area,  with  the  start  times  never  differing  by  more  than  30 

minutes,  and  the  intervals  in-between  sessions  varying  very  little.  In  addition, 

acoustic and visual cues (such as trainers preparing and setting up the food buckets) 

were easily perceptible to the dolphins, allowing them to predict the start time of the 

upcoming  feeding  session.  This  was  confirmed  by  a  previous  study  on  anticipatory 

behaviour in this group of dolphins (Jensen et al., 2013), as well as in other facilities 

following similar fixed schedules (Clegg et al., 2017b; Miller et al., 2011b). Therefore, 

for  this  study,  observations  of  anticipatory  behaviour  before  feeding  sessions  were 

conducted  5  min  before  the  session  start.  Observations  were  made  in  person 

(always IC) and the observer was elevated in the stands above the pool, hidden from 

the dolphins.    

For all contexts in Question 2 (Toys, HAI and feeding sessions), our response 

variable  for  analysis  was  the  same:  focal  individual  sampling  was  used  to  measure 

the  duration  (in  s)  of  the  two  principal  anticipatory  behaviours  (Table  2)  before 

summing them and calculating the duration as a percentage of observable time. 

2.3.2 Measuring dolphins’ participation in Toy and HAI contexts 

Regarding the trials with the Toys and HAI reward contexts, the methodology 

and  data  collection  was  exactly  the  same  as  for  Question  1,  and  is  described 

throughout section 2.2 above. The only added element was that video footage (same 

equipment)  was  also  taken  during  the  10  min  that  the  context  was  presented 

(equipment  and  position  detailed  in  2.2)  which  enabled  us  to  collect  data  on  the 

animals’ level of interaction with or interest in either the toys or during the HAI (Table 

5b). The same response variable was used during both situations: the duration (in s) 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						120	

	
of the focal dolphin’s interaction or time spent with the object/human, defined as not 

only  physical  contact  but  also  when  the  animal  was  investigating  and  focussing  its 

attention on the object/human (Neto et al., 2016) (Table 7).  

Table  7  Definitions of behaviours used for measurement of participation in the three 

events  (adapted  from  Brando,  2010;  Delfour  and  Beyer,  2012;  Eskelinen  et  al., 

2015).

Feeding session 

Focal dolphin is within 1m of the toy or the human 
(the “object”) and making almost constant eye 
contact with it. The animal may also be touching, 
rubbing, mouthing or vocalising in the direction of 
the object.  

The dolphin voluntarily moves away more than 2m 
from the trainer, and leaves this area for more 
than 5 seconds. Such breaks are similarly defined 
when another dolphin is involved i.e. another 
animal may chase the focal away from the trainer, 
or the focal may leave the trainer to interact with 
another nearby animal.   

2.3.3 Measuring dolphins’ participation in feeding sessions 

The  dolphins  in  this  study  participated  in  positive  reinforcement  feeding 

sessions  where  they  received  fish  after  performing  conditioned  behaviours,  and 

where  there  is  no  punishment  or  negative  outcome  for  their  leaving  the  trainer’s 

presence  (Laule  et  al.,  2003).  The  trainer  represents  the  primary  reinforcement  of 

food  provision,  as  well  as  secondary  reinforcers  (e.g.  offering  play  or  rubs,  Brando, 

2010),  and  all  trainers  conducting  feeding  sessions  during  this  study  were 

experienced staff members and familiar to the animals. Thus we might assume that 

the decision of the dolphin to swim away from the trainer and the fish reflects that the 

animal is not motivated to access these reinforcements. This reluctance may be due 

to the dolphin feeling uncomfortable with the situation, bored, fearful, frustrated, more 

interested  by  other  activities  in  the  pool,  or  a  combination  of  all  of  these  (Brando, 

2010).  Therefore,  as  a  measure  of  participation  in  feeding  sessions,  we  observed 

how  many  times  the  focal  dolphin  took  a  “break”  from  the  session  i.e.  it  voluntarily 

swims  away  from  the  trainer,  either  as  a  solitary  action  or  in  response  to  other 

dolphins’  social  behaviours  (Table  7).  This  variable  was  calculated  and  used  in 

analysis  as  the  number  of  breaks  per  minute,  in  order  to  account  for  the  slight 

variation  in  feeding  session  duration.  Observations  of  feeding  sessions  were  made 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						121	

	
daily, in person (always by IC), and the specific session to be observed (including the 

5  minutes  before  to  collect  the  anticipatory  behaviour  data)  was  chosen  at  random 

(Table  5b).  These  observations  were  conducted  between  December  2016  and 

February 2017. 

2.4 Data analysis  

Statistical  analyses  were  done  with  R,  version  3.1.1  (R  Development  Core 

Team,  2016).  To  test  the  hypothesis  in  our  first  question  of  whether  the  dolphins 

performed less anticipatory behaviour before the Control context than the Toys and 

HAI contexts, and whether the frequency differed between these latter situations, we 

constructed  linear  mixed  effect  models  using  the  R  package  nlme  (Pinheiro  et  al., 

2016).  P-values  were  calculated  by  Monte  Carlo  sampling  with  1000  permutations, 

using  the  R  package  pgirmess  (Giraudoux,  2016).  Such  permutation  tests  are 

particularly  adequate  when  sample  sizes  are  moderate  and  do  not  have  any 

assumptions regarding normal distribution of residuals (Good, 2005). Homogeneity of 

variances was verified by plotting fitted values versus residuals (Faraway, 2006). The 

response  variable  was  anticipatory  behaviour  duration  as  a  percentage  of  visible 

time,  and  averaged  per  individual  for  each  context.  First,  the  three  level  factor  of 

“Context” would be included in the model as a predictor of the duration of anticipatory 

behaviour.  If  this  yielded  a  significant  result,  post-hoc  tests  consisting  of  pairwise 

linear  mixed  effect  models  (again,  with  permutation  tests  to  extract  P-values,  1000 

runs)  between  the  Control,  Toys  and  HAI  contexts  would  be  conducted.  All  models 

included dolphin identity as a random factor and sex as a fixed factor. However, sex 

was never significant (P > 0.10) and thus was reduced from the models before these 

were recalculated.  

 

Our  second  question  asked  whether  the  animals’  participation  in  the 

upcoming, signalled event was predicted by the anticipatory behaviour duration in the 

period preceding access to it. First, we investigated whether the averaged values of 

anticipatory  behaviour  and  the  behaviours  reflecting  the  level  of  participation  (see 

sections  2.3.2  and  2.3.3)  were  correlated,  using  Spearman’s  rank  correlation  tests. 

We also tested for an association between anticipation and participation while taking 

into  account  intra-individual  variation:  for  these  two  behaviours,  the  deviation  from 

the individual means for each context was calculated, and used as variables in linear 

mixed  effect  models  LMM  (with  permutations),  with  one  model  for  each  context 

where participation was measured (Toys, HAI and feeding sessions).  

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						122	

To  enhance  our  analysis  and 

thus  conclusions  about 

the  dolphins’ 

anticipatory behaviour, we also calculated the repeatability of the performance of this 

behaviour  by  each  individual.  Data  on  the  frequency  of  anticipation  in  the  5  min 

before all four different types of contexts were used: Control, Toys, HAI, and training 

sessions. We used intra-class correlation based on a linear mixed effects model with 

permutation  tests  (package  rptR,  Nakagawa  and  Schielzeth,  2010),  where  we 

calculated  the  repeatability  (R;  based  on  10,000  bootstrap  runs)  of  the  individuals’ 

anticipatory  behaviour  (duration  as  a  percentage  of  observable  time),  including  sex 

and “Context” as additional factors.  

3. Results 

HAIs 

3.1.  Comparison  of  anticipatory  behaviour  duration  before  the  Control,  Toys  and 

Anticipatory  behaviour  duration  was  significantly  different  between  the  3 

contexts (LMM with 1000 permutations: P < 0.001). Post hoc comparisons revealed 

that  anticipatory  behaviour  duration  before  both  the  Toys  and  HAI  contexts  was 

significantly higher than before the Control context, and anticipation duration before 

the HAI was significantly higher than for before the Toys context (Fig. 11). 

3.2. Repeatability of anticipatory behaviour 

Anticipatory  behaviour  was  significantly  repeatable  at  the  individual  level 

across  the  three  months  of  the  study,  indicating  that  individual  dolphins  showed  a 

tendency to either display higher or lower levels of anticipation for upcoming events 

(R = 0.192, P < 0.001).  

event 

3.3.  Association  between  anticipatory  behaviour  and  participation  in  the  upcoming 

There  were  no  significant  associations  between  the  averaged  values  in 

individual  anticipatory  behaviour  and  the  averaged  individual  participation  in  the 

provision  of  toys  (Spearman  rank:  rs  =  0.428,  P  =  0.354),  the  HAI  (rs  =  0.200,  P  = 

0.571),  and  the  feeding  sessions  (rs  =  –0.286,  P  =  0.556).  That  is,  inter-individual 

differences in anticipation did not explain inter-individual differences in participation. 

However,  when  considering  intra-individual  variation  across  the  different  trials,  we 

found  significant  and  positive  correlations  between  the  anticipatory  behaviour  and 

subsequent  participation  in  the  Toys  (LMM  with  1000  permutations:  β  =  0.216  ± 

0.100 SE, P = 0.039; Fig. 12a) and HAI events (β = 0.274 ± 0.097 SE, P = 0.008; Fig.

anticipation behaviour and the number of breaks (measure of participation) displayed 

during  subsequent  feeding  sessions  (β  =  –0.169  ±  0.080  SE,  P  =  0.045;  Fig.  12c), 

where  those  dolphins  showing  more  anticipatory  behaviour  also  took  less  voluntary 

breaks  during  the  following  session.  That  is,  intra-individual  variation  in  anticipatory 

behaviour  significantly  explained

context were used as the predictor variable. (a) The first context consisted of the addition of toys to the pool (naverage trials per dolphin = 14) where 

participation  was  measured  as  the  duration  (s)  of  interaction  with  the  toys  (see  Table  7  for  definitions),  and  then  deviation  from  individual 

means for each context was used as the response variable. (b) The second context tested was a Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) (naverage trials per 

dolphin = 15), where participation was measured in the same way as the Toys context. (c) The event in the third context was feeding sessions 

(naverage trials per dolphin  =  22),  with  participation  being  measured  as  the  number  of  voluntary  breaks  the  animal  took  per  minute  (full  definition  in 

Table 7), which then was again calculated as deviation from individual means. Associations were tested using LMM (with 1000 permutations);

4. Discussion 

Dolphins  showed  significantly  more  anticipatory  behaviour  before 

the 

opportunity for a non-alimentary HAI than before the arrival of toys (and before both 

contexts  performed  significantly  and  considerably  more  anticipatory  behaviour  than 

before  the  control  situation).  Furthermore,  it  was  also  found  that  the  more 

anticipatory  behaviour  performed  before 

the  event, 

the  more 

the  dolphins 

subsequently participated in the event (in both food and non-food contexts). 

 4.1 Anticipatory behaviour reflects motivation to participate in event 

We will first discuss our results showing that anticipation levels are correlated 

to subsequent participation, since this novel finding aids our later discussions on the 

dolphins’  anticipation  towards  non-alimentary  events.  Perhaps  due  to  the  fact  that 

most anticipatory behaviour research has been conducted in relation to food rewards 

(Storch and Weitz, 2009), no previous studies have expressly looked at whether an 

animal’s anticipatory behaviour predicts motivation to exploit the reward/event once it 

arrives. Using the dolphin model, we were able to measure the animals’ participation 

in two non-food (HAI and toy provision) and one food-related (feeding during positive 

reinforcement  training  session)  event,  and  found  that  in  all  contexts  anticipatory 

behaviour predicted participation. In addition this relationship was shown using intra-

individual data, where even if the dolphins’ anticipation and participation varied from 

day-to-day  the  correlation  between  the  two  variables  remained  present  and 

significant. Our findings here are important because we can make inferences on the 

meaning  of  anticipatory  behaviour:  those  dolphins  performing  the  most  anticipatory 

behaviour  beforehand  were  also  those  who  participated  the  most  in  the  event, 

therefore suggesting that they were positively anticipating and placed intrinsic value 

on  the  three  contexts  tested  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001).  Anticipatory  behaviour  towards 

negative events also occurs (e.g. Moe et al., 2006) and this could be an alternative 

explanation  for  our  results:  however,  if  this  was  the  case  here  and  the  dolphins 

viewed  the  events  as  negative,  we  might  have  seen  high  levels  of  anticipation  but 

low  participation.  We  therefore  propose  that  the  study’s  dolphins  likely  perceived 

non-food  HAIs  with  familiar  trainers,  the  arrival  of  toys,  and  feeding  during  positive 

reinforcement training sessions, as positive or rewarding events overall and that their 

anticipatory  behaviour  represented  a  measure  of  motivation  for  resources  in  the 

surrounding environment.  

4.2 The dolphins’ perception of enrichment and HAIs with familiar trainers 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						126	

Firstly,  our  experimental  protocol  was  validated  in  terms  of  the  events  being 

conditioned to the different cues: the average levels of anticipatory behaviour before 

both  toy  provision  and  HAIs  was  more  than  double  when  compared  to  the  control 

context (10.7% versus 4.4% of observable time). Given that interacting with the toys 

and  familiar  trainers  was  an  entirely  voluntary  choice  for  the  dolphins  in  our 

experiment, and given that more anticipatory behaviour beforehand was correlated to 

higher participation in the event, we concluded that they viewed both toys and HAIs 

with familiar trainers as positive and rewarding: this is something that has not been 

demonstrated empirically before. Concerning environmental enrichment, it was not a 

surprise  that  the  dolphins  performed  anticipatory  behaviour  before  the  provision  of 

toys since the literature shows they interact willingly with toy items (e.g. Clark et al., 

2013;  Delfour  and  Beyer,  2012).  However,  although  research  shows  domesticated 

animals  likely  view  positive  HAIs  as  rewarding  (Schmied  et  al.,  2008;  Tallet  et  al., 

2005; Waiblinger et al., 2006), very few studies have investigated non-domesticated 

species’ motivation towards or enjoyment of interactions with humans (Baker, 2004; 

Carlstead, 2009). A single study on captive dolphins (T. truncatus) showed that they 

voluntarily  approached  familiar  trainers  to  be  rubbed,  outside  of  food  provision 

sessions  (Perelberg  and  Schuster,  2009).  Therefore,  our  results  provide  the  first 

convincing evidence that a non-domesticated zoo species looks forward to and thus 

positively anticipates HAIs with familiar caretakers. Unlike many past HAIs studied in 

zoos (Krebs et al., 2017; Whitham and Wielebnowski, 2013), the HAIs studied here 

were “free contact” situations i.e. there were no barriers and the animal could contact 

the  trainer  however  they  liked  (although  for  standardisation  purposes  trainers  were 

never  fully  swimming  in  the  water).  The  unique  trainer-dolphin  relationship  may 

explain the animals’ motivation to interact with their caretakers: relative to other zoo 

animals  and  their  keepers,  dolphins  spend  more  time  in  proximity  with  the  trainers 

since they participate in multiple daily training sessions (Clegg et al., 2017b; Hosey 

and  Melfi,  2010)  which  often  involve  physical  contact  and  working  together  to 

complete  tasks  (Brando  et  al.,  2016).  This  habitual  interaction  in  the  animals’  lives, 

as  well  as  the  fact  that  they  conduct  high  levels  of  tactile  behaviours  solitarily  and 

with  conspecifics  (e.g.  Dudzinski  et  al.,  2012),  suggests  that  our  results  show  the 

dolphins’  motivation  to  conduct  such  affiliative  inter-specific  behaviours  with  the 

trainers.  Finally,  it  could  be  argued  that  the  dolphins  automatically  associate  the 

trainers  with  food  provision:  however,  given  that  the  dolphins  had  experienced  the 

type of non-food HAIs in our study for many years and which were very different from 

the  context  of  feeding  sessions,  we  believe  it  is  unlikely  that  they  interacted  with 

trainers  with  the  hope  of  acquiring  food.  Nevertheless,  future  studies  might  aim  to 

	
 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						127	

	
disentangle the effects of food conditioning with affinity towards the caretaker, as has 

been conducted with lambs, Ovis aries (Boivin et al., 2000; Tallet et al., 2005). 

 

There is much need for further research into the broader topic of anticipatory 

behaviour.  This  is  well-demonstrated  by  our  results  on  the  repeatability  of 

anticipatory  behaviour,  which  has  not  yet  been  investigated  in  other  studies.  We 

found  that  dolphins’  anticipatory  behaviour  is  individually  stable  in  the  longer-term 

(over  our  3-month  study),  but  that  it  varies  day-to-day  and  between  contexts. 

Therefore  if  using  as  a  measure  of  affective  state/welfare,  individual  tendencies 

might  need  to  be  taken  into  account,  and  perhaps  measures  of  variance  of  the 

behaviour should be favoured.  

Implications and conclusions 

The  findings  of  this  study  have  significant  implications  for  the  captive 

management  of  cetaceans  and  other  species.  As  mentioned  in  many  previous 

studies,  in  order  for  an  environmental  enrichment  program  to  be  effective  in 

stimulating  activity  and  positive  behaviours,  data  must  be  collected  on  the  animals’ 

interactions with the objects and fed back to influence future protocols (Clegg et al., 

2015;  Delfour  and  Beyer,  2012).  Our  study  suggests  a  valid  tool-  frequency  of 

anticipatory  behaviour-  that  can  indicate  the  motivation  levels  for  enrichment  items. 

To  use  this  tool,  zoo  facilities  would  simply  condition  animals  to  cues  which  signal 

varying  forms  of  enrichment,  and  use  the  varying  levels  of  anticipatory  behaviour 

preceding the different enrichment types as a measure of their “want” for each one. 

Another,  more  direct  implication  of  our  study  concerns  the  opportunity  for  non-food 

HAIs  for  captive  cetaceans,  which  our  results  suggest  are  events  that  they  look 

forward  to  and  want  to  participate  in.  For  example,  the  welfare  impacts  of  the 

regulation passed by the US Department of Labor banning trainers at SeaWorld from 

swimming with killer whales, Orcinus orca (US Department of Labor, 2010) may need 

to be considered again in light of our results. 

 

The anticipatory behaviour of dolphins has successfully revealed preferences 

of  events  provided  to  them:  the  dolphins  performed  more  anticipatory  behaviour 

before the opportunity for an HAI than the provision of toys to the pool. For the first 

time, it was been shown that an animal’s anticipatory behaviour intensity is linked to 

subsequent participation in the upcoming event. Our results highlight the importance 

of  enrichment  programs  and  HAIs  in  zoos  as  drivers  of  positive  welfare.  There  are 

many  practical  implications  of  these  findings,  but  in  general,  anticipatory  behaviour 

can  be  measured  by  zoo  managers  or  scientists  to  closely  monitor  enrichment  and 

 

 

	

Chapter	4:	Further	investigation	into	anticipatory	behaviour						128	

	
HAI protocols (as well as others) to verify the animals’ motivation. Nonetheless, more 

investigations  are  needed  on  anticipatory  behaviour  in  all  species  in  order  to 

understand 

its 

intra-individual  stability,  context-dependent  variability,  and 

the 

thresholds  reflecting  different  affective  states.  Despite  these  many  unknowns  we 

hope our findings demonstrate the significant value of this behaviour both in welfare 

research  and  as  an  applied  management  tool,  thus  providing  the  impetus  for  future 

work.

Rationale for the project 

 

The  findings  described  in  the  above  chapters  show  that  conducting  well-

designed  experiments  can  lead  to  successful  advances  in  the  measurement  of 

bottlenose  dolphin  emotions  and  affective  states.  However,  due  to  time  and 

geographical  limitations,  these  studies  are  based  on  moderate  sample  sizes  of 

animals and thus further work is needed to confirm the results apply to other groups 

of  animals.  Furthermore,  while  there  are  many  advantages  to  conditioning  the 

dolphins to certain cues or tasks so that questions can be asked of them, such work 

may  not  have  the  most  direct  benefits  to  animal  managers  who  are  looking  for 

simple, feasible welfare indicators to measure on a daily basis in order to monitor the 

positive  or  negative  states  of  their  animals  (Napolitano  et  al.,  2010;  Whitham  and 

Wielebnowski,  2009).  Qualitative  Behavioural  Assessments  (QBAs)  are  often  used 

as  valid  indicators  of  certain  behavioural  dimensions  or  welfare  in  farm  species 

(Rutherford  et  al.,  2012;  Wemelsfelder,  2007),  and 

lately  similar  qualitative 

approaches are being used with zoo animals as well (Phillips et al., 2017; Whitham 

and Wielebnowski, 2009). Situations where captive animals participate in training or 

interactive sessions with their caretakers can provide an opportunity for assessment 

of the animals’ demeanour and emotions (Fleming et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2017). 

It  has  been  shown  in  many  terrestrial  species  that  motivation  to  perform  operant 

tasks significantly changes if the animal is in pain (e.g. Brando, 2012; Nagaraja and 

Desiraju,  1994)  or  experiencing  social  stress  (e.g.  Pedersen  et  al.,  2002; 

Søndergaard and Ladewig, 2004): the same has been reported in one dolphin study 

(Waples  and  Gales,  2002)  but 

is  often  described  anecdotally 

(personal 

communication).  The  protocol  in  many  facilities  is  to  take  notes  on  the  dolphin’s 

behaviour  after  every  training  sessions  (personal  communication),  but  unfortunately 

this  valuable  data  is  difficult  to  use  as  it  is  taken  differently  between  parks,  and 

among  different  trainers  within  parks.  Therefore  the  goal  of  this  project  was  to 

develop a standardised method for collecting regular qualitative and quantitative data 

on  the  motivation  for  training,  social  situation,  inappetence  and  health  status  of 

bottlenose dolphins and apply it in multiple facilities. 

Research question 

Can qualitative scoring scales be developed to measure motivation for training, new 

rake marks and health status in captive bottlenose dolphins, and can this feasibly be 

applied in multiple, international facilities?

Methodology 

Given  that  the  principal  aim  of  this  project  was  to  develop  a  simple  and 

applicable  tool  to  indicate  the  welfare  of  dolphins  in  captive  facilities,  the  data 

collection  techniques  had  to  remain  uncomplicated.  In  order  to  capture  as  much  of 

the  variation  between  individuals  and  facilities  as  possible  the  study  needed  to  be 

conducted  over  a  substantial  time-frame  with  a  large  sample  size  of  animals:  this 

further  rendered  the  need  to  keep  the  separate  welfare-related  measures  simple. 

Five  facilities  (Parc  Astérix,  Planète  Sauvage,  Dolfinarium  Harderwijk,  Attica  Park 

and Boudewijn Seapark) from four countries are participated in the project, resulting 

in an average of 60 bottlenose dolphins involved over the course of the study period. 

Data collection was conducted from around October 2016 until September 2017 but 

some facilities started later than others, resulting in an average number of 11 months 

of  data  collection.  Due  to  the  time-frame  and  sample  size,  the  study  required  that 

data  was  collected  by  the  personnel  at  each  facility,  where  steps  were  taken  to 

standardise and ensure inter-observer agreement (see details below). The four data 

elements  collected  were:  a  “Trainer  score”  of  each  dolphin’s  behaviour  during  each 

training  session;  a  “Vet  score”  where  the  resident  veterinarian  scored  the  general 

health status of the animal; a “Social score” of the extent of new rake marks on the 

animal to indicate social stress; and an “Inappetence score”, where the number of kg 

of  fish  eaten  that  day  out  of  the  total  offered  was  noted  (a  quantitative  score, 

whereas  the  others  are  qualitative).  The  trainer  score  was  hypothesised  to  be  the 

predictor  variable  in  terms  of  reflecting  changes  in  the  other  measures,  and  the 

process  to  test  its  validity  was  similar  to  Whitham  and  Wielebnowski’s  (2009)  study 

testing  zoo  animal  welfare  scoring  by  keepers.  We  first  developed  the  species-

specific  scoring  scale  for  the  “Trainer  score”,  and  plan  to  correlate  it  with  other 

welfare-related items (i.e. the other measures), before ensuring its application to the 

facility’s management system.   	

		

Trainer  scores:  5-point  Likert  scale  of  dolphin’s  motivation  during 

training sessions	

Keeper scoring of animals’ behaviour and emotions has been shown to be a 

valid measure of welfare in zoo research (e.g. King and Landau, 2003; Robinson et 

al.,  2017;  Whitham  and  Wielebnowski,  2009).  The  dolphins’  motivation  during 

positive  reinforcement  training  sessions  (including  shows  and  all  other  types  of 

	
 

	

	

	

	

 

	

Chapter	5:	Behavioural	and	health	measures	within	a	practical	tool						133	

	
session, training techniques described in Brando, 2010) was already being measured 

by  the  trainers  at  two  of  the  study  facilities  using  a  3-point  Likert  scale.  These 

existing scores were based on elements including, but not limited to, the number of 

times the animal chose to leave the trainer (such “breaks” are never punished), the 

dolphin’s enthusiasm for tasks, vocalisations indicating excitement, and the attention 

of  the  animal  on  the  trainer.  For  this  project,  we  developed  similar  scales  but 

established  5-point  scores  and  structured  the  scale  descriptions  using  principles 

similar to Qualitative Behavioural Assessments (QBAs). QBAs have often been used 

to successfully assess terrestrial animal emotional state and welfare through strong 

correlations with physiological and other quantitative measures of welfare (Fleming et 

al., 2013; Stockman et al., 2011; Wemelsfelder, 2007). The strength of QBAs lies in 

the fact that they can incorporate multiple, subtle indicators of welfare simultaneously 

to yield a holistic evaluation, whereas choosing certain quantitative measures might 

not  always  capture  such  underlying  states.  (Wemelsfelder,  2007;  Whitham  and 

Wielebnowski,  2009).  The  qualitative  Trainer  score  here  can  be  defined  as  in  the 

style of QBAs but nonetheless slightly different as Visual Analog Scales (VAS) were 

not used and we aim to measure motivation, as opposed to emotional expressivity.  

 

The  reference  scale  that  was  established  to  score  the  dolphins’  behaviour  

during  sessions  (Fig.  13)  was  developed  using  the  previous  scales  of  the  two 

facilities, the consensus of the experienced trainers at each facility, and behavioural 

data  collected  almost  daily  over  two  years  (by  myself)  during  all  types  of  training 

sessions at Parc Astérix. Once developed, the scale was tested for over six months 

at Parc Astérix before small adjustments were made based on suggestions from the 

trainers. In the actual data collection phase at all facilities, the scores were noted per 

dolphin  per  session  by  the  trainer  who  had  primarily  interacted  with  the  animal  for 

that  session.  In  order  to  increase  standardisation  of  the  scoring  between  trainers, 

reference  videos  were  made  for  each  of  the  0-4  scores  and  were  given  to  the 

facilities.  The  videos  included  footage  showing  typical  examples  of  behaviours 

indicative  of  each  score,  accompanied  by  on-screen  text  explanations  of  why  the 

behaviour was linked to the score (versions in both English and French). In order to 

increase  accuracy  and  concordance  between  the  trainers,  before  data  collection 

started  I  visited  each  park  at  the  beginning  period  of  the  project  in  order  to provide 

these  videos  and  complete  some  examples  of the  scoring  with  the  staff.  To  assess 

inter-observer  reliability,  a  representative  selection  of  trainers  from  each  park  will 

score several video examples taken of dolphins’ behaviour during sessions and the 

Intra-class Correlation Coefficient will be calculated.

dolphin’s motivation during each training session. A 0 is given if the animal does not 

approach the trainer at all (come to a stop within 1 m), and scores 1-4 are given if the 

dolphin  is  “present”  at  the  session  where  trainers  should  correspond  as  closely  as 

possible  the  dolphin’s  behaviour  with  the  scale  descriptions  and  reference  videos 

provided.	

Vet scores: 3-point Likert scale of dolphin’s overall health as related to welfare, 

conducted by resident veterinarians	

Each  facility  had  an  associated  veterinarian  who  conducted  examinations  of 

the  animals  at  least  once  a  week,  and  for  this  project  they  agreed  to  also  take  a 

general score of health at the same time. The developed 3-point Likert scale (Fig. 14) 

was designed to capture, very generally, whether the animal was likely to have any 

health issues which would result in negative emotions/feelings and sometimes loss of 

function.  This  stipulation  was  important  to  define  for  the  veterinarians  since  it 

stemmed  from  on  our  “feelings-based”  welfare  definition  of  the  thesis  (Spruijt  et  al., 

2001),  where  health  does  not  impact  welfare  unless  it  has  an  impact  on  affective 

state  i.e.  an  asymptomatic  tumour  would  not  be  classified  as  causing  poor  welfare 

(Mason and Veasey, 2010). Thus the three points on the scale were simply labelled 

as  adequate  health,  poor  health  and  very  poor  health,  and  again  during  the 

consultation pilot phase of the project where some veterinarians provided feedback, 

small adjustments were made to the descriptions for the scores. The Vet score was 

taken once per week for each animal during the data collection phase.

Social  scores:  3-point  Likert  scale  of  the  new  rake  marks  seen  on  dolphins 

each day	

As  mentioned  previously,  the  limitation  of  this  study  is  that  complex  data 

cannot be taken reliably in a standardised fashion at each facility. Therefore although 

there surely exists better measures of social stress and disturbance in dolphins, we 

needed  to  establish  a  relatively  simple  indicator  with  a  practical  method  of 

measurement. We used a Likert scale to measure three levels of the extent of new 

rake  marks  on  an  individual’s  body,  using  a  human  hand  as  a  simple  reference  to 

increase  standardisation  (Fig.  15).  Rake  marks  have  been  shown  to  be  proxy 

measures  of  aggression  in  dolphins  (Marley  et  al.,  2013;  Scott  et  al.,  2005),  and  it 

has been proposed that extensive marks are indicators of poor welfare (Clegg et al., 

2015;  Waples  and  Gales,  2002).  Rake  marks  can  also  sometime  result  from  high-

arousal  play  interactions  but  rarely  would  appear  as  extensive  when  compared  to 

those  due  to  truly  agonistic  encounters  (Scott  et  al.,  2005;  personal  observations). 

During the visit conducted to all facilities at the beginning of the study, photographs 

were provided to clearly differentiate between old and new rake marks. This measure 

was taken by the trainers for each dolphin on a daily basis.	

Inappetence  scores:  kilograms  of  fish  eaten  that  day  out  of  total  offered  to 

dolphin	

It has been described previously in this thesis how inappetence is likely to be 

a measure of poor welfare in dolphins, and may be caused by either health or social 	

reasons (Johnson et al., 2009; Waples and Gales, 2002). Therefore in this project

Fig.  15 A 3-point Likert scale of the new rake marks seen on an individual dolphin, 

measured each day by a trainer. 

the number of kilograms of fish that the dolphin ate that day was noted down, as well 

as  the  total  amount  offered  so  that  a  percentage  of  what  the  dolphin  ate  could  be 

calculated. Since all facilities started and ended the day with a “free-feed”, where fish 

was given without asking conditioned behaviours and at the end of day this included 

all  the  fish  not  eaten  in  the  previous  sessions,  food  was  never  withheld  from  the 

animals and thus any inappetence could be assumed to be voluntary refusal.	

Next steps for the project 

After  data  collection  is  finished  in  September  2017  the  next  months  will  be 

occupied  by  integrating  it  together,  and  analysis  will  begin  soon  after  depending  on 

its distribution and the quality of the data. 

The  overall  aim  is  to  investigate  whether  the  dolphins’  behaviour  during 

training  is  correlated  to  measures  of  social  stress  and  health-problems.  By 

considering the timeframe of the scores collected, we will also be able to ask whether 

behaviour  during  training  can  act  as  an  early  predictor  of  these  welfare-related 

problems.  Only  one  study  has  directly  shown  that  behaviour  during  training  might 

indeed  be  a  salient  welfare  indicator  in  bottlenose  dolphins  (Waples  and  Gales, 

2002). A multidimensional approach to measuring welfare such as this is supported 

by  the  Triangulation  principle,  since  combining  different  categories  of  measures  is 

the  best  way  to  identify  changes  in  an  animal’s  affective  state  (Webster,  2005).

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion	

The  goal  of  this  thesis  was  to  identify  and  develop  potential  welfare 

parameters  for  bottlenose  dolphins.  The  initial  studies  of  the  project  facilitated  a 

deeper  understanding  of  the  literature  and  diurnal  variance  in  the  dolphins’ 

behaviours.  As  a  result,  we  were  then  able  to  suggest  welfare  measures  for  this 

species  (synchronous  swimming,  anticipatory  behaviour,  play),  tools  to  measure 

affective 

states 

(cognitive 

bias 

testing, 

qualitative 

ratings), 

and 

resources/management  protocols  that  seem  to  promote  positive  welfare  (HAIs,  toy 

enrichment). This progress should stimulate further studies in the field, continuing to 

fill the gaps in the knowledge regarding measuring the welfare of dolphins. 

 

The  key,  underlying  attribute  of  ‘welfare’  is  its  holistic  nature:  it  can  only  be 

discussed  in  a  multi-factorial,  all-encompassing  manner  (Broom  and  Fraser,  2015; 

Dawkins, 2006). In order to understand and study welfare in a manageable fashion, 

we can consider it as a bottom-up structure of simpler elements that combine over a 

number of steps, finishing with overall welfare (Fig. 2). The discussion of this thesis is 

organised  in  this  way:  after  presenting  the  main  findings  and  highlighting  their 

significance as some of the first steps in the field, behaviours are presented that we 

can  now  say  are  likely  linked  to  dolphins’  emotions  and  possibly  affective  states, 

before  it  is  considered  how  the  findings  might  contribute  to  overall  welfare 

assessment.  The  discussion  finishes  by  highlighting  some  much-needed  lines  of 

future  research  that  would  continue  to  expand  our  understanding  of  how  dolphins 

experience their captive environment.  

Main findings of the thesis 

Research  efforts  into  animal  welfare  first  focussed  on  farm  animals,  before 

spreading to companion and laboratory species, and, only very recently, have been 

increasing for zoo animals (Whitham and Wielebnowski, 2013). Therefore as a single 

species  found  in  zoo  collections,  there  were  very  few  studies  on  the  welfare  of 

bottlenose dolphins before this thesis (Clegg et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2016). Of course, 

the field of cetology covers many different topics with wild and captive cetaceans, but 

this  information  had  never  been  brought  together  in  terms  of  animal  welfare 

principles and questioning (Hill and Lackups, 2010; Hill et al., 2016).

 Overview of results  

The  thesis  started  by  addressing  the  non-existence  of  a  dialogue  between 

cetology  and  welfare  science,  and  a  review  paper  was  written  (Paper  1)  in  order  to 

lay the foundations for cetacean welfare assessment. The principle of ‘Triangulating’ 

welfare measures (Webster, 2005) guided the review as it did the entire thesis, and 

current  knowledge  in  cetacean  behaviour,  health  and  cognition  was  evaluated  and 

used  to  propose  potential  welfare  measures  in  each  category.  While  the  review 

identified  numerous  health-  and  cognition-related  potential  measures,  it  became 

apparent  that  behavioural  measures  represented  the  most  promising  and  feasible 

category  of  welfare  parameters,  based  on  the  available  literature  from  wild  and 

captive settings. In the past, before the realisation of emotion research with animals, 

health  measures  were  thought  to  be  the  most  closely  associated  to  welfare  state 

(Dawkins,  2006).  However,  it  is  now  agreed  upon  that  behavioural  measures  are 

crucial  to  comprehensive  evaluations,  and  may  even  be  more  informative  about 

welfare  than  health  indicators  (Gonyou,  1994;  Joseph  and  Antrim,  2010;  Maple, 

2007).  In  response  to  this,  and  in  order  for  behavioural  data  to  be  collected  in  a 

standardised way during the different studies and among the parks, a comprehensive 

ethogram  of  all  bottlenose  dolphin  behaviours  was  constructed  for  this  thesis  using 

definitions from the literature and in situ observations (Thesis ethogram, Chapter 2).  

 

The  review  paper  and  supposed  significance  of  behavioural  measures 

prompted the first empirical study of this thesis, which explored the daily variation in 

dolphin behaviours in relation to the time-schedule of training sessions (Paper 2). In 

order  for  meaningful  conclusions  to  be  made,  it  was  imperative  that  such  a  study 

used a larger and more diverse sample than had been conducted before (see Miller 

et al., 2011b), and thus 29 bottlenose dolphins from three international facilities were 

recruited  for  the  project.  The  main  findings,  that  synchronous  swimming,  play  and 

anticipatory  behaviour  were  modulated  by  timing  of  training  sessions,  provided  the 

premise for the following experiments of the project. 

 

In  another  first  for  the  field  of  dolphin  welfare,  cognitive  bias  tests  were 

developed and applied to the bottlenose dolphins at Parc Astérix (Papers 3 and 4). 

This was also the first time such tests had been conducted in a  zoo setting or on a 

marine  mammal  species  (Bethell,  2015;  Roelofs  et  al.,  2016).  Thus  far,  measuring 

cognitive  bias  is  one  of  the  only  valid  tests  of  animals’  affective  state  and  welfare, 

with  numerous  cross-species  results  showing  that  more  “optimistic”  judgements 

(ambiguous stimuli judged positively) are correlated with better welfare (Mendl et al., 

2009; Roelofs et al., 2016). Given that very little is known about dolphins’ emotions 

and  affective  states  (Kuczaj  et  al.,  2013),  and  that  these  animals  in  captivity  are 

	
 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						140	

	
highly  trainable  for  such  tasks  (Brando,  2010),  the  application  of  cognitive  bias 

testing within this thesis was welcome progress (see Appendix A.4 and A.5 for media 

articles). It was previously suggested that the link between animals’ social behaviour 

and  cognitive  biases  should  be  explored  (Wichman  et  al.,  2012),  and  taking 

measurements from spontaneous social interactions is a means of investigating this 

(instead  of  trying  to  manipulate  social  welfare  conditions  experimentally,  which  is 

unlikely to be reliable). Our study correlated cognitive bias results with spontaneous 

behaviours (social and anticipatory) observed outside of test sessions, an approach 

which  has  not  commonly  been  adopted  in  the  field  but  which  yielded  thought-

provoking  results.  We  were  able  to  show  that  higher  frequencies  of  synchronous 

swimming (Paper 3) and lower frequencies of anticipatory behaviour (Paper 4) were 

correlated to dolphins’ optimistic biases. 

 

Following  the  results  linking  anticipatory  behaviour  to  cognitive  bias,  and  its 

proposed  use  as  a  measure  of  affective  state  (van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007; 

Watters,  2014),  we  decided  to  further  investigate  it  in  more  detail.  In  Paper  5,  we 

wanted  to  see  whether  dolphins  would  also  anticipate  non-alimentary  events,  and 

chose two common contexts: toy enrichment and positive Human-Animal Interactions 

(HAI)  with  familiar  trainers.  HAIs  with  trainers  and  the  impact  on  welfare  had  been 

the  subject  of  early  discussions  in  the  thesis  (see  model  in  Appendix  B.1),  as  this 

inter-specific relationship had been little investigated in the past (Clegg et al., 2015) 

and  it  was  unknown  whether  dolphins  viewed  such  events  positively/as  rewards,  or 

not.  Our  study  (Paper  5)  also  investigated  a  new  question  concerning  anticipatory 

behaviour  which  had  not  yet  been  addressed  in  other  species:  is  the  level  of 

anticipatory  behaviour  correlated  to  participation  in  the  expected  event?  We  were 

able to show that participation was indeed reflected by anticipation beforehand, and 

that  the  dolphins  anticipated  positive  Human-Animal  Interactions  more  than  toy 

provision, but that both were likely to be seen as rewarding.  

 In situ feasibility of the project 

It has been argued that conducting welfare research in situ i.e. at the farm or 

zoo  as  opposed  to  a  laboratory,  is  much  more  likely  to  be  successful  since  the 

expertise of the animal caretakers can be exploited, the animals are in their “real-life” 

environment, and afterwards the results will be more applicable for improving welfare 

(Dawkins,  2006).  A  gratifying  but  unforeseeable  component  of  this  thesis  was 

revealed  when  it  became  clear  that  welfare  research  in  the  dolphins’  day-to-day 

environment  could  indeed  simultaneously  benefit  the  animals,  caretakers,  and 

scientists.  For  example,  in  the  cognitive  bias  experiments  (Papers  3  and  4)  it  was 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						141	

	
decided  not  to  separate  the  animals  in  order  not  to  cause  isolation  stress  (seen  in 

this species, Esch et al., 2009), and despite initial misgivings the dolphins all learnt to 

discriminate  the  cues  and  completed  the  test  with  no  problems.  More  studies  may 

also start to take this approach, since a recent review emphasised the advantages of 

non-isolation  during  cognitive  bias  testing  (Roelofs  et  al.,  2016).  The  cognitive  bias 

study  involved  teaching  the  dolphins  a  new  behaviour  using  positive  reinforcement 

training  (shown  to  enhance  welfare,  Laule  et  al.,  2003),  and  they  seemed  to  enjoy 

learning and performing this new task as exemplified by their continued participation 

and  motivated  attitude  (personal  observations  of  multiple  dolphin 

trainers). 

Furthermore, once the research was completed, the results were able to inform the 

animal care team about individual dolphins’ judgement tendencies and the potential 

meaning  behind  synchronous  swimming  and  anticipatory  behaviour.  The  study  on 

anticipatory behaviour and non-food events (Paper 5) was able to inform the facility 

management  that  the  dolphins  viewed  positive  HAIs  as  a  rewarding  event,  and  of 

course  the  animals  benefitted  since  throughout  the  experiment  they  were  given 

access  to  these  HAIs  and  toys  as  well.  A  last  example  of  the  compatibility  of 

ethological/welfare research and captive dolphins is reflected by the final study in the 

project  (Paper  6),  where  it  is  planned  to  correlate  qualitative  ratings  of  motivation 

during  training  to  social  and  health-related  welfare  data  to  discover  whether  this 

feasible  scoring  system  can  indicate  changes  in  welfare.  It  is  hoped  that  this  data 

facilitates  the  development  of  a  practical  welfare  tool,  which  would  give  facility 

managers  an  overall  picture  of  the  dolphins’  state  as  well  as  detecting  more  subtle 

changes in welfare.   

 Practical limitations 

Concurrent to the successes of the project, there were also many limitations 

given that it represents the first steps into dolphin welfare research. Limitations of the 

reasoning  used  to  interpret  the  results  are  discussed  in  the  following  sections,  and 

the  limitations  regarding  designing  and  executing  the  experiments  are  highlighted 

here.  For  example,  although  multi-facility  studies  (Papers  2  and  6)  allowed  an 

increased  sample  size  of  animals  and  broader  conclusions  to  be  made,  the 

geographical  distance  between  facilities  and  the  different  management  protocols 

between them meant that to ensure standardisation, only relatively simple data could 

be  taken.  This  led  to  limitations  in  our  discussions,  for  example  in  Paper  2  the 

frequency  of  slow-close  synchronous  swimming  peaked  after  training  sessions,  but 

we were unable to deduce whether the type of training session differentially affected 

this  behaviour.  In  the  cognitive  bias  experiments  at  Parc  Astérix  (Papers  3  and  4), 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						142	

	
the test subject was not permitted to be isolated from the rest of the group and thus 

testing  occurred  in  the  presence  of  all  dolphins.  We  limited  interference  as  best  we 

could, principally by using a separate section of the pool (Fig. 6, Paper 3, Chapter 3), 

but we could rule out the possibility of interference to an animal’s return latency from 

the cues which could lead to non-independence of results. Non-independence could 

potentially  have  been  a  factor  in  our  results  for  Paper  5  where  we  were  measuring 

individual  anticipatory  behaviour  towards  predictable  contexts,  again  tested  in  a 

group  setting.  Anticipatory  behaviour  performed  by  certain  dolphins  could  have 

influenced  the  levels  seen  in  others,  but  the  alternative  situation  where  dolphins 

would have to be socially isolated could have equally confounded the results through 

increased stress to the animals. Ultimately, studies should develop and test welfare 

measures  in  situ  since  this  is  where  the  animals  spend  their  lives  (Dawkins,  2006), 

while at the same time, as with most zoo research, controlling as much as possible 

for problems of experimental design and independence and formulating conservative 

conclusions (Whitham and Wielebnowski, 2013).  

Findings and pertinence to measuring emotions 

The main findings regarding potential indicators of emotion mostly concerned 

dolphin  behaviour,  although  some  health-related  and  cognitive  measures  were 

investigated  as  well.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  behavioural  measures  are 

relatively  feasible,  often  making  up  a  large  proportion  of  terrestrial  welfare 

assessments,  and  that  there  is  an  apposite  level  of  existing  behavioural  knowledge 

on dolphins (Maple, 2007; Wells and Scott, 1999). This section follows the schematic 

of the breakdown of overall welfare (Fig. 2) and here I start with the basic elements: 

by  reviewing  how  the  behavioural  parameters  discovered  may  be  linked  to  dolphin 

emotions,  and  thus  might  be  eventually  useful  in  measuring  affective  states  and 

overall welfare (Mendl et al., 2010).  

 

 Play behaviour 

Although  often  observed  more  frequently  in  young  animals,  play  occurs 

during adulthood in a number of species (e.g. Bradshaw et al., 2015; Cordoni, 2009; 

Palagi and Paoli, 2007), including cetaceans (Hill and Ramirez, 2014; Paulos et al., 

2010).  In  general,  play  behaviour  occurs  in  the  absence  of  fitness  threats  and  as  a 

result  has  long  been  considered  an  indicator  of  good  welfare  (review  by  Held  and 

Špinka, 2011). However its inclusion in standardised welfare assessments has been 

somewhat  limited  due  to  problems  over  defining  the  behaviour  and  the  large  inter- 

 

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						143	

	
and intra-individual variation (Boissy et al., 2007; Held and Špinka, 2011). Difficulties 

with  finding  a  definition  of  dolphin  play  are  no  exception,  and  thus  far  research  has 

remained  largely  descriptive  (Kuczaj  and  Eskelinen,  2014;  Paulos  et  al.,  2010). 

Nevertheless, such studies have revealed important fundamentals of patterns of play 

in  cetaceans:  it  seems  that  while  both  adults  and  young  play,  it  is  the  calves  that 

produce  the  innovative  and  novel  play  behaviours,  and  in  doing  so  they  can  also 

increase the levels of play in the group as a whole (Hill and Ramirez, 2014; Kuczaj 

and  Eskelinen,  2014).  Similar  to  synchronous  swimming,  play  can  spread  through 

behavioural contagion, and thus the emotions linked to the activity can surely transfer 

as well (Kuczaj and Eskelinen, 2014; Špinka, 2012) making it a worthy candidate for 

investigations into its utility for measuring dolphin welfare. 

 

As part of this thesis, the frequency of play (social and object) behaviour was 

investigated  in  relation  to  the  timing  of  training  sessions,  in  four  different  groups  of 

dolphins  (n  =  29,  Table  2,  Paper  2).  It  was  found  that  play  frequency  differed 

significantly  with  the  timing  of  sessions,  but  in  an  interaction  with  age:  post-hoc 

testing revealed that juvenile dolphins played more than adults in the time in-between 

the sessions (at other points the difference was not significant). While this difference 

is likely due to the higher rates of play seen in younger dolphins (Paulos et al., 2010), 

it  also  shows  that  elements  of  the  captive  environment  can  significantly  impact  the 

occurrence  of  dolphin  play.  Following  this  line  of  research,  a  parallel  study  (which 

was not part of this thesis) was conducted at Parc Astérix and found that factors such 

as  noisy  construction  work  significantly  decreased  dolphin  play,  and  providing 

environmental  enrichment  increased  social  play  (Serres  and  Delfour,  2017).  The 

authors thus concluded that social play has much potential as a welfare indicator for 

dolphins.  

 

Concurrent to the study by Serres and Delfour (2017), the frequency of social 

play  was  investigated  for  associations  with  cognitive  bias  (Paper  3).  We  predicted 

that  higher  play  frequencies  might  be  associated  with  higher  optimism,  but  no 

significant  results  were  found:  that  is,  a  dolphin’s  individual  judgement  bias  did  not 

seem  to  affect/be  affected  by  the  performance  of  social  play.  Of  course,  the  non-

significant  result  here  cannot  be  concluded  as  the  absence  of  an  association,  but 

equally  we  can  tentatively  explore  some  possible  contributing  factors.  The  study’s 

time frame may have played a role: the behavioural data represented 75 minutes of 

observation  time  over  three  days,  and  this  may  not  have  been  a  large  enough 

window to capture accurate individual play frequencies. Alternatively, it could be that 

bottlenose dolphin play may not have a strong correlation to positive affect. Although 

increased  play  seems  to  be  linked  to  better  welfare  and  positive  emotions  in  many 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						144	

	
species (Held and Špinka, 2011) there are also some contrasting findings. One such 

study with domestic horses found that higher frequencies of social play were linked 

with  multiple  signs  of  poorer  welfare  (Hausberger  et  al.,  2012).  In  dolphin  species, 

play  fights  escalate  into  real  fights  increasingly  with  age  (review  in  Kuczaj  and 

Eskelinen, 2014) and therefore it could be that social play behaviour in this group of 

animals is a double-edged sword with regards to the influence on emotional states. 

 

Following  on  from  this  study  and  using  indications  from  the  literature,  it  was 

investigated whether object and interspecific play (with a familiar human) could also 

be useful in welfare evaluations. Given that our time limitations may have prevented 

us capturing the true levels of social play in Paper 3, our approach for the next study 

was  to  induce  play  behaviours  by  systematically  providing  the  dolphins  with  the 

relevant opportunities. The experiment (Paper 5) studied the dolphins’ responses to 

signalled  opportunities  for  interacting  with  a  familiar  trainer  (HAI)  or  accessing  toy 

enrichment. We found that they performed anticipatory behaviour before both events 

but  anticipated  HAIs  significantly  more,  and  that  in  this  study  anticipation  was 

correlated  to  subsequent  participation  in  the  event  i.e.  object  play  with  the 

enrichment,  and  inter-specific  play  with  the  humans.  We  therefore  concluded  that 

these  events,  and  thus  the  opportunity  to  perform  these  types  of  play  behaviour, 

were  perceived  as  rewarding.  In  terms  of  bottlenose  dolphin  object  play,  the  many 

examples  in  wild  and  captive  settings  (e.g.  Delfour  et  al.,  2017;  Kuczaj  and 

Eskelinen,  2014;  Paulos  et  al.,  2010),  along  with  our  study’s  findings  that  play  with 

objects  was  positively  anticipated,  suggest  that  this  type  of  play  is  also  a  likely 

indicator of positive emotions and possibly welfare in this species.  

 

Another  interesting  finding  from  Paper  5  was  that  significantly  more 

anticipatory behaviour was displayed before a positive HAI with a familiar trainer than 

before enrichment provision, and furthermore every dolphin in the group individually 

showed this trend. This could reflect a lack of interest in the enrichment provided at 

this facility and/or a desire to interact with the trainers: our results do not allow us to 

distinguish which factor was predominant (if either) in this “preference”. However, in 

terms  of  motivation  for  the  event,  anticipatory  behaviour  was  also  shown  to  predict 

participation  levels  (time  spent  with  the  trainer)  and  so  it  seems  that  in  general  the 

dolphins in this group “wanted” to interact with the trainers (no aggressive or sexual 

behaviour  towards  humans  was  seen:  interactive  behaviours  included  visual  and 

tactile play). Therefore, similar to other types of play, it could be that interspecific play 

between dolphins and familiar humans at least is also a potential measure of positive 

emotions and welfare. However, apart from this thesis, there are no previous studies 

on dolphin emotions or motivation towards HAIs, with only a few descriptive studies 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						145	

	
existing  about  play  or  tactile  behaviour  during  interactions  with  humans    (Kuczaj  et 

al., 2006; Paulos et al., 2010; Perelberg and Schuster, 2009). Many dolphin species 

are regularly observed conducting intra-specific tactile and play behaviour (Dudzinski 

et  al.,  2012;  Kuczaj  et  al.,  2013),  and  thus  in  captivity  the  animals  might  transfer 

these behaviours to the familiar humans present in their environment (Paulos et al., 

2010),  possibly  viewing  them  as  heterospecific  social  partners  (Perelberg  and 

Schuster,  2009;  Servais  and  Delfour,  2013).  To  fill  the  gaps  in  our  knowledge, 

studies  should  delve  deeper  into  the  HAIs  between  trainers  and  dolphins,  as  very 

little is known about how profound these keeper-animal relationships are (Hosey and 

Melfi,  2010)  and  how  they  might  influence  dolphin  welfare.  Furthermore,  dolphin 

species  have  been  shown  to  react  differently  to  familiar  versus  unfamiliar  humans 

(e.g. Thieltges et al., 2011), and it would be interesting to see whether similar levels 

of anticipatory behaviour are shown towards humans they are not familiar with, or to 

familiar humans who are not involved with providing food to the animals. 

Synchronous swimming 

Synchronous  swimming  is  a  common,  affiliative  behaviour  seen  in  many 

dolphin species in both wild and captive settings (Connor et al., 2006b; Harvey et al., 

2017;  Sakai  et  al.,  2010).  The  exact  definition  used  throughout  this  thesis  is  where 

two  or  more  animals  swim  within  one  body  length  of  another,  corresponding  their 

movements  and  body  axes,  with  0-2  seconds  delay  between  each  individual 

surfacing  for  breathing  (based  on  Connor  et  al.,  2006a;  Harvey  et  al.,  2017; 

Holobinko and Waring, 2010). The review paper (Paper 1) at the start of the project 

briefly highlighted synchronous swimming as a possible indicator of positive welfare 

states, and therefore it was included in the suite of behaviours studied in relation to 

timing of training sessions in Paper 2. In addition, in this paper we went a step further 

and delineated the behaviour by speed and distance to partner which resulted in four 

variants  of  synchronous  swimming:  slow-close,  slow-distant,  fast-close,  fast-distant 

(see  Thesis  ethogram,  Chapter  2,  for  definitions).  This  was  conducted  in  order  to 

start  investigating  whether  different  variations  of  synchronous  swimming  might 

indicate different emotions and possibly welfare. This step turned out to be a prudent 

choice:  the  results  showed  that  slow-close  synchronous  swimming  was  the  only 

variant  to  significantly  change  in  frequency,  where  it  increased  shortly  after  training 

sessions. It was suggested that this increase of a calm, socially affiliative behaviour 

showed  that  the  dolphins  were  motivated  to  be  reunited  after  being  under  human 

control (although not physically separated) during training sessions. This hypothesis 

is  supported  by  acoustic  results  from  the  dolphin  group  at  Parc  Astérix  taken  at  a 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						146	

	
similar  time,  where  it  was  found  that  the  rate  of  signature  whistles  also  increased 

significantly  shortly  after  training  sessions:  such  whistles  are  often  considered  as 

social  cohesion  calls  so  these  results  also  suggest  an  increase  in  social  affiliation 

after training sessions (Lopez Marulanda et al., 2016).   

 

Although the causes of synchronous swimming frequency changes were not 

confirmed in Paper 2, such findings are important in terms of uncovering the intention 

behind  these  social  behaviours  for  the  dolphins,  and  thus  the  link  this  may  have  to 

their  emotions.  For  example,  it  has  often  been  reported  that  during  intra-  or  inter-

specific  aggression  and  ‘intense’  social  behaviour,  the  level  of  synchronous 

swimming  or  at  least  synchronous  behaviours  is  increased  (e.g.  Connor  et  al., 

2006b; Herzing and Johnson, 1997). In trying to explain the behaviour in this context, 

the utility of adding the variable of speed and distance is evident: it can be imagined 

that the type of synchronous swimming seen in ‘intense’ social behaviour might be at 

higher speeds than during relaxed, low-energy affiliation.  

 

In  Paper  3,  cognitive  bias  paradigms  were  used  to  test  for  correlations 

between biases and social behaviours, such as synchronous swimming. Due to the 

shorter  behavioural  data  collection  phase  (over  3  days,  compared  to  2  months  for 

Paper 2), synchronous swimming was not differentiated by distance and speed (the 

implications of this will be discussed later). Those dolphins that made more optimistic 

judgements  were  also  those  that  conducted  more  synchronous  swimming  in  their 

‘free-time’.  Elsewhere,  over  one  hundred  studies  on  many  different  species  have 

shown that optimistic judgements are correlated to positive affective states or welfare 

conditions (most recent review by Roelofs et al., 2016). Therefore we could conclude 

from  our  cognitive  bias  tests  with  the  dolphins  that  higher  synchronous  swimming 

frequencies were likely to be correlated to more positive emotions, such as ‘relaxed’ 

or ‘happy’ (Mendl et al., 2010). The influence of social behaviour on cognitive biases 

has only been studied a few times, where laboratory rats were more pessimistic after 

experiencing  chronic  social  stress  (Papciak  et  al.,  2013)  and  canaries  judged  more 

optimistically when pair-housed (Lalot et al., 2017). These two examples support the 

notion that affiliative social behaviour is linked to optimistic judgements and positive 

affective states, but more studies in this area are crucial and have been specifically 

recommended (Wichman et al., 2012). 

The  findings  concerning  social  affiliation  and  emotions  within  this  thesis  are 

just a part of the vast topic of positive emotions and measuring welfare (Boissy et al., 

2007).  More  questions  can  immediately  be  asked  regarding  the  dolphins:  our 

previous study (Paper 2) showed that more work on the speed and distance between 

the dolphins is needed to be able to fully understand the link between synchronous

swimming  and  positive  emotions.  This  was  not  possible  during  the  cognitive  bias 

experiment  due  to  time  constraints  and  the  fact  that  the  hypotheses  were  focussed 

on  a  range  of  social  behaviours,  not  just  synchronous  swimming.  However,  such  a 

protocol  could  be  used  again  to  test  whether  all  variants  of  synchronous  swimming 

are  indeed  linked  to  positive  affective  states.  The  problem  of  distance  between 

animals  also  arises  for  farm  animal  researchers  trying  to  establish  affiliative 

behaviour  as  an  positive  emotion  indicator,  since  these  animals  may  also  decrease 

the  distance  from  their  partner  when  faced  with  an  environmental  threat  (Boissy  et 

al.,  2007).  However  this  does  not  confound  the  use  of  affiliative  behaviour  as  a 

welfare measure by any means: although it may be displayed in stressful as well as 

non-stressful  circumstances,  the  result  of  increasing  social  cohesion  and  support  is 

clearly  the  same.  Affiliative  behaviours  in  more  stressful  situations  are  thought  to 

function  by  moving  the  animal’s  emotional  state  back  towards  the  positive  side,  so 

that  homeostasis  is  not  unfavourably  impacted  (Rault,  2012).  Therefore  those 

animals  that  have  diminished  social  support,  as  shown  by  no  or  low  levels  of 

affiliative  behaviours  during  stressful  times,  would  likely  be  in  a  worse  state  than 

those  who  have  such  a  ‘stress  buffer’  available  to  them  (Rault,  2012;  Waples  and 

Gales,  2002).  Stress  buffering  and  terrestrial  animal  welfare  has  been  studied  with 

findings showing that social support can greatly mitigate the effects of stress (latest 

review  by  Rault,  2012):  hence,  an  opportunity  exists  to  investigate  the  same 

concepts with captive dolphins, where evidence already suggests that stronger social 

bonds can ensure better overall health and welfare (Brando et al., 2016; Hoffland et 

al., 2017; Waples and Gales, 2002). Based on our results and the available literature, 

synchronous swimming, as an affiliative, bond-enhancing activity, may be one of the 

behaviours  which  increases  social  support,  and  thus  we  recommend  further 

investigations to fully understand its relevance to dolphin welfare.  

Anticipatory behaviour 

Anticipatory  behaviour  describes  the  activity  conducted  in  response  to  the 

predicted occurrence of an upcoming event (Spruijt et al., 2001). Its performance is 

thought to reflect the individual’s sensitivity to the reward. For example, if an animal 

is  consistently  deprived  of  a  desired  resource  it  is  likely  to  experience  a  more 

negative affective state, leading to a higher reward sensitivity (more ‘incentive value’ 

placed  on  the  resource)  and  therefore  more  anticipatory  behaviour  is  performed 

before the reward finally arrives (van der Harst and Spruijt, 2007; see Fig. 16 below, 

taken  from  Watters,  2014).  Inducing  anticipatory  behaviour  may  also  function  as  a 

tool  to  improve  welfare  since  ‘looking  forward’  to  an  event  can  be  as  rewarding  as 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						148	

	
having access to the resource itself (Moe et al., 2009; Watters, 2014). Reviews of the 

literature supporting the link between anticipatory behaviour and affective states can 

be found in Papers 4 and 5 (and in: van der Harst and Spruijt, 2007; Watters, 2014).  

Fig.  16  Predictive  model  of  anticipatory  behaviour  from  Watters  (2014),  modified 

from  van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt  (2007).  The  x-axis  represents  the  animal’s  welfare 

state as indicated by the balance between positive and negative experiences. Here, 

there is specific reference to the frequency of these experiences and, for the sake of 

explanation,  an  assumption  that  they  all  have  the  same  value.  In  other  words,  a 

positive  event  is  equally  as  positive  as  a  negative  event  is  negative.  When  positive 

events  are  common,  the  opportunity  to  anticipate  them  is  also  common  and  the 

frequency  of  anticipatory  events  is  high.  However,  because  of  frequent  occurrence, 

positive  events  do  not  generate  incredibly  intense  anticipation.  As  positive  events 

become rarer, they also become more important to the animal. Here, the intensity of 

anticipatory  behaviour  increases  as  a  result  of  the  animal’s  increased  reward 

sensitivity.  Also,  the  frequency  of  individual  bouts  decreases  because  fewer  bouts 

are initiated by relevant cues. The shaded grey area represents chronic stress. This 

is the area where negative outcomes are so much more common than positive ones 

that  the  animal’s  normal  functions  are  disrupted.  Here,  low  intensity  of  anticipation 

results  from  disrupted  homeostatic  systems.  Here  also,  a  low  frequency  of 

anticipatory bouts results from rare opportunities to express the behaviour. 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						149	

The  first  study  to  explicitly  investigate  anticipatory  behaviour  in  cetaceans 

was conducted on the bottlenose dolphin group at Parc Astérix a few years prior to 

this  thesis,  and  found  that  dolphins  increased  certain  vigilance-related  behaviours 

before the start of training sessions or shows (Jensen et al., 2013). Since then, one 

other has been conducted where false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) seemed 

to vocally anticipate food-provision training sessions (Platto et al., 2015). Due to the 

lack  of  available  studies,  the  behavioural  repertoire  used  in  Paper  2  of  this  thesis 

included anticipatory behaviours based on previous studies’ descriptions of vigilance 

behaviour  towards  above-surface  events  (Jensen  et  al.,  2013;  Miller  et  al.,  2011b). 

Indeed, we found that our proposed anticipatory behaviours collectively increased in 

frequency  shortly  before  food-provision  training  sessions  (occurring  on  a  fixed, 

predictable  schedule).  We  did  not  study  the  number  of  behavioural  transitions  as  a 

measure  of  anticipation,  as  has  been  conducted  in  some  other  studies  (Moe  et  al., 

2006;  van  der  Harst  et  al.,  2003a),  due  to  the  fact  that  dolphins  were  able  to  be 

vigilant to poolside activity while swimming or even social swimming. Further studies 

that validate methods to measure cetaceans’ behavioural transitions would be useful.  

 

The  results  from  Paper  2,  and  the  growing  body  of  literature  supporting  its 

links  to  welfare  measurement,  prompted  us  to  focus  further  on  anticipatory 

behaviour: as part of the subsequent experiment, we aimed to correlate anticipatory 

behaviour to individual cognitive bias (Paper 4). The two most commonly described 

surface  vigilance  activities  were  chosen  as  reflecting  the  dolphins’  “anticipation”, 

based on the findings in Paper 2 and the literature: surface looking (animal orientates 

head  and  eye(s)  towards  poolside  area,  either  while  swimming  forward  or  while 

floating  stationary)  and  spy-hopping  (vertical  movements,  often  repeated,  above 

water’s  surface  that  allow  viewing  of  poolside  area).  These  two  behaviours  were 

defined  in  this  study  as  ‘anticipatory  behaviour’  towards  food-provision  training 

sessions. The sessions occurred on a fixed schedule, almost always started from the 

same  area,  with  various  environmental  cues  available  to  predict  the  arrival  of  the 

trainers  (e.g.  buckets  being  prepared)  for  the  start  of  the  session.  Considering  that 

both  cognitive  bias  testing  and  anticipatory  behaviour  are  thought  to  be  linked  to 

affective state, a previous study has already aimed to correlate results from the two 

phenomena  (Wichman  et  al.,  2012).  However,  in  this  investigation  on  laying  hens 

(Gallus  gallus  domesticus)  there  were  no  significant  correlations  found,  and  the 

authors put this down to individual differences. In our study which led to Paper 4, we 

wanted  to  test  for  such  an  association  in  captive  dolphins  and  we  based  our 

predictions on the reward sensitivity theory: we expected higher levels of anticipatory 

behaviour  to  be  correlated  to  more  pessimistic  judgements,  since  the  literature 

	
 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						150	

	
suggests  these  both  reflect  negative  affective  states.  Our  results  showed  that  the 

more optimistic dolphins anticipated the sessions less (significant association for the 

Near-positive cue and a tendency for the Middle cue), and we thus provide the first 

evidence  for  the  link  between  cognitive  bias  and  anticipatory  behaviour.  Of  course, 

there  is  much  more  work  needed  in  order  to  fully  understand  the  meaning  of  these 

results and our experiment had limitations: for example, anticipatory behaviour may 

vary in appearance among individuals and we did not take this into account (in this 

study,  but  see  repeatability  tests  in  Paper  5).  We  were  not  able  to  control  for  the 

exact  nature  and  timing  of  the  cues  signalling  the  start  of  training  sessions  which 

may  have  resulted  in  some  inaccuracy  regarding  the  animals’  actual  anticipation  of 

the training, and possibly could account for the tendency towards significance for the 

Middle  cue  results,  or  the  lack  of  correlation  to  the  Near-less-positive  cue.  There  is 

also the possibility that the animals view the training sessions as aversive and thus 

are  negatively  anticipating  them,  although  this  is  unlikely  since  such  responses  are 

usually behaviourally distinct from positive anticipation (e.g. Zimmerman et al., 2011). 

Furthermore,  participation  in  training  sessions  is  voluntary  for  the  animals  (Brando, 

2010),  where  the  only  consequence  of  not  attending  is  that  they  receive  the  food 

planned for that session at the end of the day instead.  

 

In  response  to  the  novel  findings  of  Paper  4  that  show  the  potential  for 

dolphin anticipatory behaviour as a welfare measure, Paper 5 used the behaviour to 

investigate  whether  the  animals  seem  to  view  the  training  sessions  and  other  non-

food  related  events  as  positive  or  negative,  as  well  as  test  whether  those  animals 

anticipating the event the most would also show higher levels of participation. Since 

few  studies  existed  on  anticipatory  behaviour  of  non-food  events  in  all  animals 

(Anderson  et  al.,  2015;  McGrath  et  al.,  2016;  van  der  Harst  et  al.,  2003b),  our  first 

question concerned testing the dolphins’ response to the signalled provision of toys 

or a positive Human-Animal Interaction with a familiar trainer (HAI). As expected, the 

animals successfully paired the cues with the contexts and showed significantly more 

anticipatory  behaviour  before  the  non-food  events  than  before  the  control  context. 

There was no existing knowledge regarding whether the animals might anticipate toy 

or  HAI  opportunities  more,  given  that  there  are  only  a  few  studies  which  even 

consider measuring HAIs with dolphins (Clegg et al., 2015; Perelberg and Schuster, 

2009; Servais and Delfour, 2013). Interestingly, we found that all dolphins performed 

more anticipatory behaviour before the HAI context than the toys, which resulted in a 

significant  difference  when  data  were  averaged.  Nevertheless,  the  same  alternative 

hypotheses  as  in  Paper  4  could  be  posed  here,  where  we  cannot  be  sure  that  the 

behaviour  being  shown  reflects  positive  or  negative  anticipation.  It  is  here  that  an 

	

	
important  second  question  was  asked  in  Paper  5,  and  aided  greatly  in  the 

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						151	

explanation of results of question one. 

 

No  previous  anticipatory  behaviour  studies  had  tested  whether  the  level  of 

anticipation  beforehand  corresponded  with  the  individual’s  participation  in  the  event 

itself  i.e.  the  consummation  of  the  goal  (whether  food-  or  non-food  related).  A  few 

studies  included  peripheral  results  which  indicated  that  there  should  indeed  be  a 

correlation  between  animals’  appetitive  and  consummatory  behaviour  (Anderson  et 

al.,  2015;  McGrath  et  al.,  2016).  Therefore,  we  decided  to  test  this  fundamental 

question with dolphins and the results were convincing: across three difference cued 

contexts (toy provision, HAIs, and food-provision training sessions) it was shown that 

the  level  of  anticipatory  behaviour  was  correlated  with  participation  in  the  event 

(different  behaviours  used  for  participation  measures,  see  Table  7  of  Paper  5). 

Furthermore  this  significant  correlation  concerned  intra-individual  data  and  not 

averages  per  individual,  indicating  that  although  the  duration  of  anticipatory 

behaviour  is  likely  to  vary  from  day-to-day,  it  remains  indicative  of  the  animal’s 

participation in the event. This relationship surely merits further investigation, since in 

terms of welfare it could be more informative about specific affective states than the 

one-dimensional  data  on  levels  of  anticipation.  It  could  be  imagined  that  an  animal 

that spends much of its time anticipating a positive upcoming reward, but then does 

not  extensively  exploit  or  engage  with  it  once  it  arrives,  might  be  in  a  state  of 

boredom  or  frustration.  More  work  is  needed  to  test  this  hypothesis,  but  for  the 

moment  it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  an  animal  that  anticipates  an  event  and 

then shows subsequent keen participation during it, is motivated, or has a “want”, for 

that  resource  (Spruijt  et  al.,  2001).  We  therefore  tentatively  suggest  that  dolphins’ 

anticipatory  behaviour  could  be  used  as  a  measure  of  motivation  towards  certain 

resources  and  events,  i.e.  as  a  type  of  “in  situ  measure  of  preference”  which 

indicates what the animal might ‘want’ in its environment (Dawkins, 2004). When this 

finding  is  coupled  with  the  results  of  question  1  in  Paper  5,  it  can  be  further 

concluded that the dolphins viewed both toy and HAI opportunities positively and that 

positive  emotions  were  likely  associated  with  the  acquisition  of  the  rewards.  Even 

before  a  reward  arrives,  a  certain  level  of  anticipation  is  known  to  induce  positive 

affective  states  in  animals  (Kamal  et  al.,  2010;  Spruijt  et  al.,  2001),  with  some 

evidence  that  these  can  exceed  the  positive  affect  resulting  from  the  reward  itself 

(Dudink et al., 2006). In order to fully understand the findings with the dolphins, in the 

next  section  I  explore  further  the  specific  “levels”  of  anticipation  which  might 

represent  differing  affective  states,  where  the  multiple  studies  must  be  considered 

together (Papers 2, 4 and 5) and in relation to the reward-sensitivity theory.  

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						152	

	
Findings in relation to affective states and overall welfare 

 

The discussion is continued by moving up a level in the bottom-up structure 

of welfare evaluation: the thesis findings are now discussed in terms of what types of 

affective states they might relate to, and how in turn this might impact overall welfare. 

Firstly,  I  delve  deeper  into  what  the  performance  of  anticipatory  behaviour  might 

mean  for  the  dolphins,  and  evaluate  its  potential  as  an  applicable  welfare 

assessment tool. In order to collectively consider the findings regarding the potential 

dolphin  welfare  indicators  in  terms  of  affective  states,  different  frequencies  of  play, 

synchronous  swimming  and  anticipatory  behaviour  are  loosely  placed  within  Mendl 

and co-authors’ (2010) framework. Lastly, since the welfare definition followed in this 

thesis describes a balance of positive and negative affective states, only taking into 

account  one  affective  state  at  a  time  may  inadvertently  lead  to  incorrect  welfare 

assessments.  Therefore,  I  briefly  discuss  approaches  to  assessments  of  overall 

welfare, and propose how these might be applied to dolphins in captivity.   

Proposed relationship between anticipatory behaviour and welfare 

As  is  likely  to  be  evident  following  the  previous  discussion  of  anticipatory 

behaviour  measured  in  Papers  2,  4  and  5,  the  frequency  at  which  the  behaviour  is 

performed  is  likely  to  be  crucial  for  deducing  the  type  of  associated  affective  state. 

Given that the thesis included multiple studies which yielded anticipatory frequencies 

within different contexts, I decided to explore whether our data on this concept could 

be  more  informative  if  it  was  all  considered  together.  A  schematic  was  constructed 

(Fig.  17)  to  map  the  relationship  between  the  level  of  anticipatory  behaviour  and 

dolphin  welfare  through  adapting  an  existing  predictive  model  based  on  the  reward 

sensitivity theory (Fig. 16, from Watters, 2014). Van der Harst and Spruijt (2007) and 

Watters  (2014)  have  constructed  and  discussed  general  models  of  anticipatory 

behaviour  and  welfare,  but  this  schematic  is  the  first  endeavour  to  apply  these 

principles  to  a  certain  species  and  attribute  specific  behavioural  frequencies. 

However,  it  is  essential  to  keep  in  mind  that  this  is  a  very  preliminary  exploration 

which includes many limitations, primarily that the behaviours defined as anticipatory 

behaviour  differed  slightly  between  Papers  2,  4  and  5,  as  well  as  their  units  of 

measurement (either as percentage of visible scans or percentage of visible time in 

seconds).  Similar  to  the  original  model  by  Watters  (2014)  (Fig.  16),  this  adapted 

schematic collectively considers anticipatory behaviour to different positive rewards. 

The  schematic  is  not  intended  to  be  used  for  detailed  predictions  and  the  absolute 

values should not be focussed upon: moreover it is simply a visual representation of 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						153	

	
this  project’s  findings,  and  what  they  might  indicate  about  welfare  if  the  reward 

sensitivity  theory  is  applied  to  dolphins.  If  extensive  further  work  was  to  be 

conducted,  the  schematic  also  shows  how  measuring  the  frequency  of  anticipatory 

behaviour might be a practical tool to aid in welfare assessment. Details of how the 

schematic  was  constructed,  including  justifications  for  the  welfare  designation  for 

each group of results, are also given below (Table 8). The model that it was based 

on (from Watters, 2014) can be found earlier in the manuscript (Fig. 16). 

Fig.  17  Proposed  schematic  showing  relationship  between  anticipatory  behaviour 

and dolphin welfare, based on Watters (2014) and van der Harst and Spruijt (2007). 

The  x-axis  depicts  the  balance  of  affective  states  and  thus  ranges  from  positive  to 

negative overall welfare (reflecting the Spruijt et al., 2001, welfare definition followed 

in  this  thesis).  The  y-axis  shows  anticipatory  behaviour  towards  various  predictable

events, which was measured as percentage of visible time (either as percentage of 

visible  scans  or  percentage  of  visible  time  in  s)  and  defined  as  the  behavioural 

patterns  established  in  preparation  for  a  predictable,  upcoming  event  (Spruijt  et  al., 

2001).  Based  on  Watters’  (2014)  predictive  model  (Fig.  16),  the  dotted  grey  line 

represents  a  threshold  above  which  such  levels  of  anticipatory  behaviour  may 

indicate chronic stress. Filled white circles represent anticipatory behaviour averages 

over  all  animals,  while  the  grey  lines  indicate  maximum  and  minimum  averages 

among individuals: Table 8 details the sources, calculation and welfare designations 

of these data. The averages of 4.4 and 4.8 represent data taken when no predictable 

event  was  scheduled  to  occur,  and  so  it  is  suggested  that  these  frequencies 

represent baseline vigilance activity by the animals.

a  link  between  anticipatory  behaviour  and  dolphin  welfare.  The  anticipatory

designations (i.e. whether the level of anticipatory behaviour in that context is likely to 

be  linked  to  positive,  neutral  or  negative  welfare  states)  are  given  based  on 

conclusions  from  each  study  and  the  current  literature,  and  the  reasoning  is 

explained  in  the  last  column.  A  “-”  indicates  that  the  level  of  anticipatory  behaviour

baseline vigilance levels.

Shortly after and in-between

predictable events to anticipate, 
therefore this level of the behaviour 
represents baseline vigilance and is 
likely not related to affective state. 
The point where the dotted line 
(mean individual return time, i.e. no 
bias, neutral affective state) 
crosses the regression line 
corresponds to 16% of anticipatory 
behaviour. (Near-positive cue data 
used as Middle cue association 
was only a tendency).

behaviour frequencies correlated to

associated with positive welfare. 
Average of the anticipatory 
behaviour frequencies correlated to 
"pessimistic" judgements (above

associated with negative welfare. 
No event occurred in the Control 
context, and a low level of 
anticipatory behaviour was 
conducted anyway, possibly as a 
baseline vigilance activity.

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						156	

The schematic (Fig. 17) uses the data yielded from the studies in this thesis 

(Table  8)  to  hypothesise  that  a  dolphin  experiencing  more  positive  affective  states 

will  likely  perform  a  certain  level  of  anticipatory  behaviour  for  predictable  rewards 

(conservative  range  might  be  between  5  and  12%  of  the  time).  As  the  balance  of 

affective  states  moves  towards  neutral,  the  animal  might  conduct  more  anticipatory 

behaviour (around ~16% of the time), and then as the balance tips towards negative 

it  may  perform  the  behaviour  at  levels  around  23%  of  the  time.  No  data  is  yet 

available but if the case with dolphins is similar to terrestrial animals that have been 

studied,  once  a  chronic  stress  stage  is  reached  (i.e.  very  negative  affective  states), 

anticipatory  behaviour  levels  would  decrease  sharply  to  0  (Kamal  et  al.,  2010;  von 

Frijtag  et  al.,  2000).  The  proximate  causation  behind  the  theory  as  it  translates  to 

dolphins suggests that a lack of stimulation in their pools and daily lives would cause 

them  to  place  higher  values  on  the  rewards  that  they  do  have,  and  thus  they 

anticipate them more. An advantage of integrating the findings of this thesis in such a 

way is that it clearly highlights the gaps in the knowledge and thus future directions. 

For  example,  our  results  showed  that  a  certain  level  of  ‘anticipatory-like’  behaviour 

occurs when there are no predicted upcoming rewards (e.g. Control context in Paper 

5),  and  this  was  tentatively  labelled  as  “baseline  vigilance”  activity  (Fig.  17).  This 

baseline  level  of  ‘anticipatory-like’  behaviour  also  occurred  in  other  studies  (e.g. 

Anderson  et  al.,  2015),  but  possible  functions  have  not  been  readily  discussed  nor 

has it been recognised in previous models (van der Harst and Spruijt, 2007; Watters, 

2014).  One  line  of  questioning  which  might  provide  information  about  baseline 

frequencies  of  the  behaviour,  and  was  touched  upon  in  Paper  5,  is  the  individual 

repeatability  of  anticipatory  behaviour.  This  had  not  yet  been  tested  in  terrestrial 

species  (Watters,  2014),  but  with  the  dolphins’  data  we  found  that  anticipatory 

behaviour  was  significantly  repeatable  at  the  individual  level  across  the  3-month 

study. Considering the other results from Paper 5 where anticipation levels were also 

context-dependent,  it  is  likely  that  individuals  show  a  tendency  to  conduct  either 

higher  or  lower  levels  of  anticipatory  behaviour,  which  are  nonetheless  subject  to 

intra-individual variation.  

 

A major limitation of the schematic is that we cannot be sure about some of 

the  ‘welfare  designations’,  that  is,  whether  the  anticipatory  data  really  taken  in 

situations  where  the  dolphins  experienced  positive  or  negative  states.  With  the 

cognitive  bias  data  of  Paper  4,  we  can  be  much  more  confident  of  the  welfare 

designations due to the fact that we “Triangulated” cognitive and behavioural welfare 

measures, which is a more accurate approach than using data from a single category 

(Dawkins,  2006;  Webster,  2005).  In  Paper  5  we  did  not  correlate  multidimensional 

	
 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						157	

	
measures:  our  controlled  conditioning  paradigm  allowed  the  dolphins  to  predict 

enrichment  and  HAIs,  where  their  anticipation  reflected  their  voluntary  participation 

and thus suggested that they found the two events rewarding. Given that simply the 

act of anticipating something rewarding can induce positive affective states (Dudink 

et  al.,  2006;  Kamal  et  al.,  2010;  van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007),  and  that  play 

behaviours  (i.e.  as  seen  with  enrichment  and  in  HAIs)  are  thought  to  be  conducted 

only  in  the  absence  of  other  primary  needs  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007;  Held  and  Špinka, 

2011),  a  “positive”  welfare  state  was  designated  to  these  levels  of  anticipation  (Fig. 

17,  Table  8).  However,  the  same  level  of  certainty  could  not  be  attributed  to  the 

affective  states  of  the  dolphin  anticipating  the  feeding  sessions  and  so  these  data 

from  Papers  2  and  5  were  not  included  in  the  model.  In  those  experiments,  many 

other  uncontrolled  factors  could  influence  whether  individuals  were  in  a  generally 

positive  or  negative  state  e.g.  training  methods,  presence  of  visitors,  other 

environmental  cues.  These  questions  regarding  the  underlying  welfare  state,  which 

are  to  be  expected  since  very  little  is  known  about  dolphin  affective  states, 

demonstrate  how  valuable  and  essential  it  is  to  correlate  multidimensional  welfare 

measures wherever possible.  

 

Recently,  another  angle  was  proposed  from  which  anticipatory  behaviour 

could  be  linked  to  welfare:  it  could  be  used  as  a  tool  to  measure  boredom,  a 

phenomenon  which  has  been  severely  understudied  in  animals  (Burn,  2017).  Time 

seeming  to  pass  slowly  is  a  known  indicator  of  boredom  in  humans  and  since 

anticipation  of  an  event  signals  a  sense  of  time  passing,  Burn  (2017)  suggested 

anticipatory  behaviours  and  conditioning  paradigms  could  be  used  to  study  the 

presence  and  implications  of  boredom  in  animals.  Much  future  work  is  needed  into 

anticipatory behaviour, from its stability over time, its utility as a welfare indicator, and 

the  significance  of  measuring  the  frequency  versus  intensity  of  the  activity.  With 

cetaceans, species-specific elements are also likely to influence on the behaviour, for 

example acoustic signalling (Platto et al., 2015), and it is hoped that the findings here 

stimulate an increase in such studies and on anticipatory behaviour as a whole. 

Thesis findings within a core affect framework 

 As a result of combining the two most popular theories of emotion and using 

well-accepted  human  psychology  principles,  Mendl  and  co-authors’ 

(2010) 

framework to measure animal affective states (Fig. 1) has been well-received in the 

animal welfare field. It has been applied conceptually to several different species and 

for different purposes (e.g. in multiple presentations at the Universities Federation for 
Animal Welfare Symposium, 15-17th May, Egham, UK). Here, I use the framework to 

 

 

	

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						158	

	
display  the  findings  of  this  thesis  in  the  same  domain  which  allows  them  to  be 

considered  collectively  as  indicators  of  dolphin  affective  states  (Fig.  18).  Similar  to 

the schematic proposed for anticipatory behaviour and dolphin welfare (Fig. 17), the 

purpose of this exercise was not to empirically position the results or establish

absolute  values  on  the  valence  and  arousal  axes,  but  instead  to  provide  a  visual 

summary  of  my  results  and  what  I  concluded  about  them  in  terms  of  welfare.  The 

indicators displayed on the adapted framework are discussed in full in the following 

sections,  and  represent  the  main  findings  of  the  thesis  (with  one  addition  of  play 

behaviour  results  from  Serres  and  Delfour,  2017,  conducted  at  Parc  Astérix). 

However  this  framework  is  by  no  means  comprehensive,  and  could  be  used  as  a 

‘working  document’  where  multidisciplinary  indicators  could  be  added  and  removed 

as  research  progresses.  The  concept  of  Triangulating  (combining)  behavioural, 

health-related  and  cognitive  parameters  results  in  a  more  accurate  and  valid 

evaluation of affective states (Désiré et al., 2002; Paul et al., 2005; Webster, 2005), 

and while this thesis yielded some behavioural measures, the next steps could be to 

investigate health, physiological and cognitive indicators of dolphins’ affective states. 

Play behaviour 

Social play was found to increase in the period in-between training sessions 

(though  only  significantly  in  juveniles),  and  it  was  tentatively  concluded  that  the 

animals  may  have  chosen  to  play  at  that  time  since  other  needs  i.e.  hunger  and 

social bonding (the latter of which we found to occur shortly after sessions, Paper 2) 

were  fulfilled.  Supporting  this,  Serres  and  Delfour  (2017)  found  that  play  behaviour 

decreased in bottlenose dolphins when noisy construction work or aggressive social 

interactions  were  occurring,  presumably  because  other  behavioural  needs  (i.e. 

finding safety) were more important to the dolphins. In Paper 5, it was found that the 

dolphins performed anticipatory behaviour in response to upcoming object and inter-

specific  play  opportunities  and,  furthermore,  that  these  were  highly  likely  to  be 

rewarding  as  higher  levels  of  anticipation  were  correlated  to  amount  of  time  spent 

with the object or familiar human. Play behaviour was placed in both quadrants 1 and 

2  of  the  framework  (Fig.  18)  since  performance  of  play  in  our  studied  contexts  was 

always deemed to be positive, but the arousal level of the animals likely varied. The 

dolphins  seemed  to  perceive  play  as  a  rewarding  context  (Paper  5)  and  thus  it 

belongs  in  Q1  as  part  of  the  reward  acquisition  system,  but  was  also  present  in-

between sessions where the animals had no other primary needs to attend to (Paper 

2) and so also fits in Q2. Play is a commonly used indicator of positive welfare, but 

different  types  of  play  (object,  social,  solitary  etc)  may  be  linked  to  slightly  different 

emotions.  The  thesis  findings  regarding  this  differentiation  were  limited,  and  further 

work is needed in bottlenose dolphins as well as other species (Boissy et al., 2007; 

Held and Špinka, 2011).

Synchronous swimming 

On  the  adapted  framework  (Fig.  18),  it  is  proposed  that  slow-close 

synchronous swimming might be linked to emotions found in Q2, leading to ‘calm’ or 

‘relaxed’ overall affective states. In contrast it is possible that fast-close synchronous 

swimming,  as  a  behaviour  shown  by  alliances  during  defensive  or  aggressive 

situations, would indicate emotions in either Q1 or Q4, although this is not shown on 

the  framework  since  this  project’s  studies  did  not  investigate  this.  The  emotions 

linked  to  synchronous  swimming  at  faster  speeds  would  depend  on  whether  the 

dolphin was ultimately trying to acquire a reward (e.g. mate with a female), in which 

case the corresponding emotion might be excitement (Q1), or to avoid a punishment 

(e.g.  defence  against  a  predator),  where  the  synchronous  swimming  would  indicate 

an emotion such as fear (Q4). However, given the lack of dolphin emotion research 

and  that  only  one  previous  study  has  investigated  synchronous  swimming  and 

included  distance  to  partner  as  a  variable  (Connor  et  al.,  2006b),  we  can  only 

hypothesise  that  slow-close  synchronous  swimming  is  an  indicator  of  positive 

emotions and must wait for future studies to continue the progress. Nonetheless, the 

short  example  above  shows  that  Mendl  and  co-authors’  (2010)  framework  could 

indeed  serve  as  an  insightful  structure  for  behavioural  indicators  of  emotions,  in 

dolphins at least, and the example with synchronous swimming variations would be 

applicable to research in both wild and captive contexts.  

 

Slow-close  synchronous  swimming  peaked  shortly  after 

food-provision 

training  sessions  within  the  four  dolphin  groups  studied  in  Paper  2,  and  it  was 

proposed that, similar to play, after the behavioural need of hunger was satisfied the 

dolphins  engaged  in  this  affiliative  behaviour  to  reaffirm  their  bonds  (Boissy  et  al., 

2007;  Connor  et  al.,  2006b).  Therefore  slow-close  synchronous  swimming  was 

placed in Q2 where it could be associated with emotions such as ‘relaxed’, conducive 

to  the  low  speed  of  this  behaviour  (and  thus  perhaps  lower  arousal  levels  of  the 

dolphins). Due to synchronous swimming (without delineations in speed or distance) 

being correlated to optimistic judgements (Paper 3), the occurrence of this behaviour 

as  a  whole  was  placed  in  Q1,  and  decreased  levels  were  thought  to  be  associated 

with  Q3  emotional  states,  since  our  cognitive  bias  paradigm  was  based  on  the 

acquisition  of  rewards.  However,  the  placement  of  the  decreased  levels  of 

synchronous  swimming  indicator  should  technically  be  in  both  Q3  and  Q4;  our 

analysis  did  not  distinguish  which  of  these  was  more  likely  to  be  the  case.  Such 

differentiation  is  possible  and  has  been  recommended  as  a  future  use  of  cognitive 

bias  testing  in  animals,  since  meticulously  analysing  the  responses  to  the  different 

ambiguous  cues  can  reveal  whether  the  animal  showed  enhanced  expectation  of  a 

	
 

 

	

	
negative event (Q4) or a decreased expectation of the positive reward (Q3) (Mendl et 

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						161	

al., 2010).   

 

While  theoretically  it  is  easy  to  explain  how  affiliative  behaviours  among 

social, group-living animals are linked to positive emotions and affective states, it is 

relatively  difficult  to  demonstrate  experimentally  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007).  Synchronous 

swimming  in  bottlenose  dolphins  is  an  indicator  of  social  bonds  and  serves  to 

reinforce  them  while  also  serving  an  adaptive  role  in  terms  of  maintaining  group 

cohesion for hunting, defence and social interactions (Connor et al., 2001; Duranton 

and Gaunet, 2016; Fellner et al., 2013). Emotions in themselves are adaptive as well, 

functioning to drive the individual’s behaviour towards seeking rewards and avoiding 

threats  (Boissy  et  al.,  2007).  Therefore  in  dolphin  populations  we  can  imagine  that 

positive  emotions  might  have  evolved  in  association  with  behaviours  that  enhance 

group  cohesion,  and  the  cognitive  bias  testing  allowed  us  to  suggest  that 

synchronous swimming is indeed linked to more positive affective states in the study 

group of dolphins. We also went a step further and took behavioural data from the 4 

months  preceding  the  bias  tests,  in  order  to  investigate  the  persistence  of  such 

proposed  affective  states  and  question  whether  the  correlation  of  bias  and 

synchronous swimming might represent more of a stable behavioural tendency. This 

question is often posed by researchers in the field (Roelofs et al., 2016), since there 

are  a  few  studies  that  suggest  cognitive  bias  may  be  linked  to  personality  traits 

(Cussen and Mench, 2014; Gordon and Rogers, 2015), but there are also others who 

find  no  effect  (Lalot  et  al.,  2017).  In  our  cognitive  bias  investigation,  we  thus 

conducted a second analysis using synchronous swimming frequencies from 0-2 and 

2-4 months before the test, applying the same approach as for the behavioural data 

taken  in  the  present.  We  found  that  in  the  0-2  months  before  the  test,  a  higher 

synchronous  swimming  frequency  significantly  predicted  more  optimistic  biases  in 

the  test,  but  that  this  association  disappeared  when  using  data  from  2-4  months 

before  the  test.  This  suggests  that  a  transitory  phenomenon,  persisting  from  a  few 

weeks  to  months,  was  causing  the  differences  in  dolphins’  biases.  The  association 

between synchronous swimming and bias is unlikely to be due to personality factors 

in  this  case,  as  then  we  would  have  expected  to  see  a  significant  correlation  when 

using  2-4  month-old  data.  This  additional,  longer-term  data  indicates  that  group 

dynamics  and  social  standings,  which  presumably  last  from  between  weeks  to 

months,  were  more  likely  to  have  driven  the  affective  states  experienced  by  the 

animals and influenced their judgements (i.e. positive social relations that led to more 

optimism).  This  is  in  line  with  current  literature  discussing  the  duration  of  affective 

states, and the role of social behaviour in overall welfare (Boissy et al., 2007; Mendl 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						162	

	
et  al.,  2010).  However,  given  our  inability  to  determine  the  causal  relationship  and 

that  an  individual’s  performance  of  synchronous  swimming  is  likely  dependent  on 

others’  behaviour  in  the  group,  we  do  not  conclude  here  that  dolphins’  personality-

like  traits  do  not  influence  cognitive  bias  or  indeed  synchronous  swimming 

tendencies: further work is needed to investigate this. Synchronous swimming, as a 

behaviour  conducted  between  one  or  more  conspecifics,  showcases  the  potential 

role  of  emotional  contagion  and  transfer  in  establishing  affective  states  and  thus  in 

welfare  measurement  (Held  and  Špinka,  2011;  Špinka,  2012).  Positive  feedback  of 

emotions  between  partners  conducting  such  behaviours  is  thought  to  occur, 

reinforcing  affiliative  bonds,  but  so  far  few  studies  exist  in  any  species  (Špinka, 

2012).  

Anticipatory behaviour 

The  acquisition  of  rewards  was  labelled  as  one  of  the  two  biobehavioural 

systems  that  drives  the  manifestation  of  affective  states  (Mendl  et  al.,  2010),  and 

anticipatory behaviour is a key component in reward acquisition (Spruijt et al., 2001; 

Watters,  2014).  The  studies  in  this  thesis  concerning  anticipatory  behaviour  in 

bottlenose  dolphins  (Papers  2,  4  and  5)  allowed  us  to  propose  a  relationship 

between this activity and welfare (Fig. 17). This is extremely useful for plotting where 

anticipatory behaviour might be placed on the adapted framework of core affect (Fig. 

18). Three designations are used for three indicators in this framework: “moderate”, 

“excessive” and the absence of anticipatory behaviour. These are intended to reflect 

to  the  frequencies  of  anticipatory  behaviour  correlating  to  positive  welfare,  negative 

welfare,  and  chronic  stress  as  shown  in  Fig.  18  and  supported  by  Watters’  (2014) 

original  model  (Fig.  16).  As  has  been  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  a  certain 

(“moderate”)  level  of  anticipatory  behaviour,  such  as  that  shown  by  the  dolphins 

before  toy  enrichment,  HAIs  and  training  sessions,  might  be  linked  to  positive 

emotions associated with reward acquisition, so this indicator was placed in Q1 (e.g. 

“excited”,  “happy”  emotions).  “Excessive”  anticipatory  behaviour,  such  as  those 

levels shown by the dolphins that also judged more pessimistically, is therefore likely 

an  indicator  of  emotions  in  Q3.  Animals  in  such  negative  states  are  much  more 

focussed on the reward’s arrival since they have fewer other rewarding experiences 

available in their current environment (van den Berg et al., 1999; van der Harst et al., 

2003a,b).  With  the  dolphins,  this  may  have  manifested  as  having  less  access  to 

positive social interactions. Although we did not find any evidence of chronic stress in 

our  studies,  Watters’  (2010)  model  and  my  adapted  version  (Fig.  17)  are  used  to 

propose that the absence of anticipatory behaviour in dolphins would be an indicator 

 

 

 

	

	
of  an  extremely  negative  and  chronic  Q3  state,  where  it  is  suggested  the  animals 

enter  a  state  of  apathy  and  anhedonia  (van  der  Harst  and  Spruijt,  2007;  Watters, 

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						163	

2014).  

 

There  is  much  to  learn  about  the  utility  of  anticipatory  behaviour  within  this 

type  of  framework:  for  example,  human  psychology  studies  have  suggested  that 

reward sensitivity “may underlie individual predispositions to particular mood states” 

(Corr,  2004;  Mendl  et  al.,  2010).  This  means  that  anticipatory  behaviour  could 

potentially indicate longer-term moods, and not just shorter-term affective states. To 

conclude  their  theories  of  core  affect  in  animals,  Mendl  and  co-authors  (2010)  also 

link  optimistic  and  pessimistic  decision-making  with  the  prevailing  environmental 

conditions  and  core  affective  states  (overall  welfare)  and  suggest  that  moods  may 

influence cognitive biases differently to shorter-term affective states. Since we tested 

cognitive bias with the dolphins (Papers 3 and 4), our results could be learned from 

and built upon in terms of measuring longer-term affective states in this species.  

Lastly,  although  we  can  spend  time  considering  these  thought-provoking 

frameworks and schematics, it goes without saying that the projections are based on 

moderate sample sizes, many of the specifics are as yet unsubstantiated, and much 

more  work  is  needed  to  validate  anticipatory  and  the  other  behaviours  as  reliable 

indicators of bottlenose dolphin affective states. 

Overall welfare assessment in practice 

Mendl  and  co-authors’ 

(2010) 

framework  and  discussion  highlights 

theoretically  how  emotions,  affective  states  and  longer-term  “free-floating”  moods 

might  interact  to  impact  core  affect  i.e.  overall  welfare.  The  underlying  common 

denominator, as shown by the systems (arrows) in the framework (original: Fig. 1; my 

adapted  version:  Fig.  18),  is  that  core  affect  is  always  linked  to  the  rewards  and 

threats  present  in  the  animal’s  environment  (Mendl  et  al.,  2010).  It  is  with  this 

information  that  we  can  progress  from  the  theoretical  domain  towards  practical 

welfare  assessments  in  the  environments  that  they  inhabit.  Of  course,  we  can  use 

such  theoretical  frameworks  to  input  different  indicators  and  determine  the  different 

affective  states  the  animal  might  be  experiencing,  and  thus  make  predictions  about 

its  welfare  state  at  a  certain  point  in  time.  But,  it  is  more  likely  that  comprehensive 

assessments  which  collect  longer-term  data  using  both  animal  and  resource-based 

measures, i.e. some associated with emotional states and some indirect measures of 

the  environment,  will  help  us  to  improve  the  welfare  of  captive  animals  (Roe  et  al., 

2011; Veissier et al., 2008).  

 

 

 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						164	

Measuring  an  animal’s  overall  welfare  is  often  the  ultimate  goal  for  those 

managing  and  regulating  animal-use  industries  since  such  information  can  be  used 

to maximise efficiency, attract consumers, and benefit the individual animals. Welfare 

assessments  are  groups  of  separate,  multidimensional  measures  (Veissier  et  al., 

2012;  Whay  et  al.,  2003)  and  are  not  yet  established  in  zoo  settings  (Bloomsmith, 

2009),  although  there  has  been  one  proposal  for  an  assessment  for  bottlenose 

dolphins (Clegg et al., 2015). While not yet tested in many groups and over time, the 
measures in Clegg and co-authors’ C-Well© Assessment are being validated as the 

studies increase in this field (e.g. Paper 5 of this thesis endorses positive HAIs as a 

rewarding situation for the dolphins). An often-cited concern with measuring welfare 

is the time-frame, where taking data at one point in time using a few measures might 

mean that a significant problem is missed due to time limitations (Roe et al., 2011). 

Farm  animal  research  has  shown  that  well-designed  holistic  assessments  can 

combat this through being “strategically redundant” (term from Clegg et al., 2015) i.e. 

a  welfare  issue  has  the  opportunity  to  be  identified  in  multiple  measures  during  the 

assessment. The results from the welfare-based studies in this thesis may also have 

been  limited  by  time,  for  example  the  lack  of  correlation  between  social  play  and 

cognitive bias in Paper 3 as discussed earlier. Furthermore, the potential behavioural 

indicators  of  welfare 

found  here  (play,  synchronous  swimming,  anticipatory 

behaviour)  can  only  be  measured  in  different  time-frames  themselves.  To  progress 

past this seemingly difficult obstacle in welfare research, we should first accept that 

although there exists an overall welfare state of an individual human or animal at any 

moment in time (Mendl et al., 2010), without a shared language we are unlikely to be 

able to determine what this is for animals instantaneously. So, to try and assess the 

welfare of an individual animal accurately (Barber, 2009), we can collect data based 

on the animal as well as its environment (Veissier et al., 2008), with multidimensional 

measures covering many aspects of their life (Pritchard et al., 2005), and sometimes 

repeating  welfare  measures  if  the  original  time-frame  is  inadequate  (Clegg  et  al., 

2015). 

 

The  concept  of  integrating  many  measures  to  be  able  to  capture  a  certain 

welfare  issue  spurred  the  establishment  of  the  final  project  of  this  thesis,  where 

qualitative  ratings  of  dolphin  motivation  during  training  sessions  were  collected  with 

basic  health  and  social  behaviour  data  to  investigate  how  changes  in  welfare 

manifest  over  time,  and  how  this  might  be  revealed  in  the  chosen  measures. 

Qualitative rating approaches such as QBAs are a method for confirming face validity 

specifically and are intended to encompass the holistic and multidimensional nature 

of an animal’s response to its environment (Stockman et al., 2011; Wemelsfelder et 

	
 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						165	

	
al.,  2012),  and  so  this  final  study’s  goal  was  to  test  their  utility  for  the  first  time  in 

dolphin  welfare  research.  It  is  hoped  that  the  results  of  this  multi-facility  study  will 

reveal  the  links  between  behavioural  and  health-related  measures  of  welfare,  and 

stimulate  progress  towards  the  application  of  standardised  tools  to  measure  overall 

welfare in captive dolphin facilities.  

Future directions 

The  novelty  of  dolphin  welfare  as  a  subject  area  means  that  there  are 

countless  future  channels  of  research  worth  exploring.  The  approach  for  this  thesis 

was  to  focus  strongly  on  behavioural  studies  and  what  they  could  reveal,  but  other 

studies could and should use other disciplines e.g. health, cognition and personality 

research,  as  their  foundations.  Our  behavioural  investigations  revealed  some 

potential  welfare  measures  for  captive  dolphins,  chiefly  synchronous  swimming, 

anticipatory behaviour and play but, as discussed above extensively, these should be 

studied  further  in  many  facilities  and  in  more  detail.  We  were  able  to  correlate 

behavioural and cognitive measures together in the cognitive bias studies, but apart 

from  that  our  time  and  sample  size  constraints  limited  our  attempts  to  correlate 

different types of measures together. Further, multidisciplinary research will continue 

the  progress  towards  identifying  indicators  of  emotions  and  affective  states,  and 

ultimately overall welfare (Fig. 2: breakdown of overall welfare). 

 

There  are  elements  from  this  thesis  with  bottlenose  dolphins  for  which  our 

data  on  novel  welfare  concepts  could  inform  studies  on  farm  or  other  terrestrial 

species,  e.g.  the  finding  that  anticipatory  behaviour  predicted  levels  of  reward 

participation,  and  that  undomesticated  animals  raised  by  humans  anticipated 

interactions with them (Paper 5). Positive HAIs have been shown to promote positive 

emotions  and  improve  welfare  in  many  domesticated  species  (e.g.  Handlin  et  al., 

2011; Schmied et al., 2008; Waiblinger et al., 2006), but our findings provide another 

model for research on HAIs and the domestication process, which up until now has 

almost  solely  focussed  on  comparing  domestic  dogs  (Canis  familiaris)  and  wolves 

(C. lupus) (Anderson and Serpell, 1996; Topál et al., 2005). With dogs, inter-specific 

play is suggested to reflect the quality of the relationship with the human, but that this 

is  an  adaptive  trait  selected  for  over  the  domestication  process  (Bradshaw  et  al., 

2015). While very different to other zoo animals’ interactions with their keepers, the 

positive  reinforcement  training  and  close,  regular  human  contact  which  is  common 

with captive dolphins seems to foster positive HAIs, which in themselves have much 

potential  as  welfare  indicators  and  enhancers  (Bloomsmith  et  al.,  2003;  Brando, 

 

 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						166	

	
2012;  Laule  et  al.,  2003).  As  the  facilitator  of  these  findings  concerning  Trainer-

Dolphin  interactions,  anticipatory  behaviour  should  be  much  further  investigated  in 

order to reach its potential as a welfare assessment tool: for example, the proposed 

model linking anticipatory behaviour and welfare (Fig. 17) could be further tested and 

developed. Although only touched upon in the above sections, the ability to anticipate 

a  reward  or  event  is  closely  linked  with  the  concept  of  increased  control  over  the 

environment,  something  which  is  thought  to  increase  welfare  in  terrestrial  species 

(Bassett  and  Buchanan-Smith,  2007;  Dudink  et  al.,  2006)  and  likely  also  in  captive 

dolphin  species  (Brando  et  al.,  2016).  There  is  much  to  be  further  investigated 

regarding  how  HAIs,  anticipatory  behaviour  and  control  over  the  environment  can 

influence dolphin welfare.   

 

Over the course of the thesis, some health-related and cognitive measures of 

welfare  were  investigated  such  as  breathing  frequency,  health  status  as  scored  by 

veterinarians,  and  cognitive  bias.  But,  due  to  limited  time  and  moderate  sample 

sizes, 

these  parameters 

(especially  physiological  measures)  did  not 

take 

precedence.  Thus  we  propose  that  an  effective  approach  for  future  dolphin  welfare 

studies  would  be  to  use  the  near-validated  behavioural  measures  found  here  to 

identify corresponding health/physiological and cognitive parameters. For example, if 

the  validity  of  cortisol  measurement  was  being  investigated,  levels  of  the  hormone 

(which  can  be  measured  from  blood,  faeces,  urine  or  saliva,  Atkinson  et  al.,  2015) 

could be correlated to the occurrence of social affiliative or anticipatory behaviour, as 

this  might  explain  some  variation.  Cognitive  bias  testing  is  one  of  the  few  available 

validated tools to indicate affective states in animals (Mendl et al., 2010), and since 

our  adapted  test  was  very  feasible  and  yielded  valuable  results  with  the  dolphins, 

similar methods should be applied further to cetaceans and in a variety of contexts.  

 

The  studies  conducted  in  this  thesis  show  that,  in  agreement  with  the 

literature  (Barber,  2009;  Whitham  and  Wielebnowski,  2013),  research  into  zoo 

animals’ welfare is indeed possible and fruitful in terms of basic and applied science. 

In  general  it  has  been  highly  recommended  that  more  zoos  collaborate  with 

ethologists  and  welfare  scientists  to  conduct  such  studies  as  were  completed  here 

(Hopper,  2017;  Maple,  2007).  A  noteworthy  difference  at  the  present  time  between 

dolphins  and  other  zoo  animals  is  their  “trainability”:  the  fact  that  the  bottlenose 

dolphins  in  our  studies  were  habituated  towards  and  responded  so  well  to  positive 

reinforcement training (Laule et al., 2003) meant that this was an invaluable tool for 

conducting  the  more  complex  studies  (Brando  et  al.,  2016)  ,  such  as  the  cognitive 

bias testing. Our experiments have directly addressed specific recommendations that 

the trainability of captive cetaceans should be harnessed to study their cognition as 

	

Chapter	6:	General	Discussion						167	

	
well as provide stimulation and enrichment for the animals themselves (Brando et al., 

2016; Maple and Perdue, 2013). It is also possible that the animal-based measures 

of  dolphin  welfare  proposed  here  could  be  used  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  specific 

resources  or  management  decisions  on  these  animals.  This  research  should  be 

multi-institutional to be able to control for the variation found between programs, such 

as  in  Baird  and  co-authors’  (2016)  study  where  they  used  behaviour  and 

glucocorticoid  levels  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  education  programs  on  a  number  of 

zoo species within many facilities; the same questioning could be applied to dolphins 

facilities using the animals’ behaviour and participation in shows/guest interactions. 

 

A  new  branch  of  work  that,  in  many  cases,  has  been  facilitated  by  captive 

animal  welfare  research  is  the  application  of  welfare  science  principles  to  wild 

animals  (Jordan,  2005;  Ohl  and  van  der  Staay,  2012).  Recently,  experts  have 

specifically  recommended  that  welfare  assessments  of  wild  marine  mammals  take 

place in order to better understand the anthropogenic and other effects on individual 

animals  (Butterworth,  2017;  Butterworth  et  al.,  2012;  Papastavrou  et  al.,  2017). 

Therefore,  although  this  was  not  a  primary  aim  of  the  overall  project,  our  findings 

could  also  be  used  to  support  welfare  research  on  wild  dolphins.  For  example, 

measuring  the  frequency  of  synchronous  swimming  is  relatively  simple  as  it  can  be 

completed from afar and from above or below water, and thus could be applied as a 

measure of social cohesion in the group. If further studies elucidate the meaning of 

differences  in  proximity  and  speed  for  this  behaviour,  it  could  be  used  as  an  even 

more  specific  measure  of  an  individual’s  affective  state.  Wild  dolphins’  affective 

states and moods are just as likely to vary with the strength of social relationships, as 

our  findings  with  captive  dolphins  suggest,  and  thus  a  measure  like  synchronous 

swimming  could  potentially  reveal  the  animals’  emotions  towards  anthropogenic 

events such as the presence of whale-watching boats. 

General conclusion 

Welfare science is a recently established discipline which aims to reveal the 

core  affective  states  of  animals,  but  which  had  not  yet  been  applied  to  dolphins. 

Using bottlenose dolphins as the study species, this thesis aimed to develop the first 

objective indicators of welfare. “Dolphin welfare” was a phrase very rarely used in the 

literature,  but  as  a  result  of  the  review  and  empirical  studies  conducted  here  the 

foundations  for  the  field  are  underway.  Validated  tools  used  in  terrestrial  animal 

welfare  research  were  applied  here:  chiefly  cognitive  bias  testing  and  a  Pavlovian

conditioning paradigm used to study anticipatory behaviour. Synchronous swimming, 

an  affiliative  social  behaviour  of  dolphins,  was  identified  as  a  likely  measure  of 

positive  emotions/affective  states  due  to  its  association  with  optimistic  judgements 

during cognitive bias testing. We showed for the first time that anticipatory behaviour 

predicts  the  level  of  participation  in  the  upcoming  event  and,  since  the  dolphins 

performed  most  anticipatory  behaviour  before  positive,  non-alimentary  Human-

Animal  Interactions  (HAIs),  we  proposed  that  the  animals  place  intrinsic  value  on 

these  inter-specific  interactions  and  find  them  rewarding.  The  cognitive  bias  study 

enriched  the  analysis  of  anticipatory  behaviour:  the  dolphins  who  performed  higher 

levels of anticipatory behaviour before training sessions also made more pessimistic 

judgements (linked to negative affect). This finding agrees with the reward sensitivity 

theory, which proposes a non-linear relationship between anticipatory behaviour and 

welfare,  where  excessive  anticipation  reflects  negative  affective  states.  We 

suggested  a  model  that  applies  this  theory  to  the  dolphins’  data,  thus  proposing  a 

relationship  between  reward  sensitivity  and  dolphin  welfare  and  demonstrating  that 

anticipatory behaviour may have great potential as a non-invasive welfare parameter. 

The lack of previous dolphin welfare studies meant that, although the studies in this 

thesis  were  able  to  identify  potential  measures  of  emotions  and  some  affective 

states,  more  research  is  needed  before  the  dolphins’  overall  welfare  can  be  more 

accurately  assessed.  The  discussion  suggests  important  lines  of  future  research, 

such  as  cross-validating  the  behavioural  measures  found  here  with  physiological 

indicators  of  affective  state,  and  further  investigating  the  intriguing  finding  that 

dolphins, as an undomesticated species, seem to significantly value positive HAIs. In 

regard  to  the  applications  of  this  thesis,  the  ultimate  goal  should  be  to  develop  a 

comprehensive  welfare  assessment  for  bottlenose  dolphins  as  this  is  the  most 

accurate way to measure overall welfare. Despite constraints with sample sizes and 

studying the animals out of a laboratory environment, this project has reinforced the 

notion  that  welfare  research  on  dolphin  species  is  feasible  and  can  yield  results 

which  are  valuable  to  managers,  scientists,  regulators  and  the  general  public.  The 

inherent subjectivity of welfare will forever remain a caveat in this discipline, but well-

designed  studies  and  conservative  conclusions  such  as  those  generated  within  this 

thesis can only enhance our knowledge, helping us to better protect and improve the 

lives of the animals we are responsible for.

Abstract						197	

Developing welfare parameters for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops 
truncatus) under human care 
 

Résumé 

La science du bien-être animal est une discipline bien établie qui permet de faire des 

mesures  objectives.  Les  grands  dauphins  (Tursiops  truncatus)  sont  une  espèce  de 

cétacés  communément  présente  en  captivité,  et  bien  que  des  questions  se  posent 

sur la qualité de leur vie dans cet environnement, très peu d'études ont porté sur la 

mesure objective de leur bien-être. Cette thèse répond à ce manque de données en 

développant des indicateurs de bien-être basé sur l’animal, ici le grand dauphin. Une 

revue bibliographique initiale a identifié des mesures potentielles de bien-être, avant 

que  des  indicateurs  comportementaux  choisis  aient  été  mesurés  par  rapport  aux 

sessions  d’entrainement.  Un  test  de  biais  de  jugement  a  alors  été  adapté  aux 

dauphins,  où  des  biais  optimistes  ont  été  significativement  liés  aux  fréquences  les 

plus hautes de nage synchronisée durant leur 'temps libre' et aux fréquences les plus 

basses de comportement anticipatoire avant les sessions d’entrainement. Une avant 

dernière étude a montré que le comportement anticipatoire a prédisait la participation 

à  l'événement à venir, et que des Interactions Humaines-Animales positives étaient 

anticipées  plus  que  l’introduction  de  jouets.  Une  dernière  expérience  en  cours  a 

développé  un  protocole  standardisé  pour  mesurer  la  motivation  des  dauphins 

pendant  des  sessions  d’entrainement  par  rapport  aux  problèmes  de  bien-être 

sociaux  et  de  santé.  Bien  que  le  bien-être  global  soit  toujours  difficile  à  mesurer, 

cette  thèse  propose  des  premières  mesures  d'émotions  et  d’états  affectifs  chez  le 

dauphin. La nage synchronisée est un indicateur probable d'émotions positives, bien 

que  plus  de  recherches  doivent  examiner  la  variabilité  entre  divers  contextes.  Le 

comportement anticipatoire semble témoigner de la motivation pour des événements 

à venir et nous suggérons qu'il reflète une sensibilité à la récompense comme chez 

d'autres  animaux:  des  travaux  ultérieurs  portant  sur  des  seuils  de  fréquence  le 

transformerait en  indicateur de bien-être pertinent. Un objectif majeur de la thèse est 

de  stimuler  plus  de  recherches  sur  des  mesures  de  bien-être  chez  des  grands 

dauphins et d'autres espèces de cétacés en captivité.

Abstract 

Welfare  science 

is  now  an  established  discipline  which  enables  objective 

measurements  of  animal  welfare  to  be  made.  Bottlenose  dolphins  (Tursiops 

truncatus) are a common cetacean species kept in captivity, and although questions 

are  arising  over  their  quality  of  life  in  this  environment,  very  few  studies  have 

focussed  on  objectively  measuring  their  welfare.  This  thesis  aimed  to  address  this 

lack of data by developing animal-based indicators of bottlenose dolphin welfare. An 

initial  review 

identified  potential  dolphin  welfare  measures,  before  selected 

behavioural  indicators  were  measured  in  relation  to  training  sessions.  A  judgement 

bias  test  was  then  adapted  to  dolphins,  where  optimistic  biases  were  significantly 

linked  to  higher  frequencies  of  synchronous  swimming  in  their  ‘free-time’  and  lower 

frequencies  of  anticipatory  behaviour  before  training  sessions,  (concurring  with  the 

reward-sensitivity  theory).  A  penultimate  study  showed  that  anticipatory  behaviour 

predicted  participation 

in 

the  upcoming  event,  and  positive  Human-Animal 

Interactions were anticipated more than access to toys. A final, on-going experiment 

has  developed  and  applied  a  standardised  protocol  for  measuring  dolphins’ 

motivation  during  training  sessions  in  relation  to  social  and  health-related  welfare 

problems.  Although  overall  welfare  is  still  difficult  to  measure,  this  thesis  has 

proposed some first measures of dolphin emotions and affective states. Synchronous 

swimming is a likely indicator of positive emotions and social support, although more 

research  should  investigate  variability  between  contexts.  Anticipatory  behaviour 

seemed to indicate motivation for events, and we suggest it reflects reward sensitivity 

as in other animals: further work into frequency thresholds would render it a valuable 

welfare  indicator.  A  major  objective  of  the  thesis  is  to  stimulate  more  research  on 

welfare measures for bottlenose dolphins and other cetacean species in captivity.

Abstract 

The  field  of  welfare  science  and  public  concern  for  animal  welfare  is  growing,  with 

the focus broadening from animals on farms to those in zoos and aquaria. Bottlenose 

dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are the most common captive cetaceans, and relevant 

regulatory  standards  are  principally  resource-based  and  regarded  as  minimum 

requirements.  In  this  study,  the  farm  animal  WelfareQuality®  assessment  was 

adapted  to  measure  the  welfare  of  bottlenose  dolphins,  with  a  similar  proportion  of 

animal-based  measures  (58.3%).  The  ‘C-Well®’  assessment  included  eleven 

criterion and 36 species-specific measures developed in situ at three marine 

mammal zoological facilities, tested for feasibility and accuracy, and substantiated by 

published  literature  on  wild  and  captive  dolphins  and  veterinary  and  professional 

expertise.  C-Well®  scores  can  be  calculated  for  each  measure  or  combined  to 

achieve  an  overall  score,  which  allows  for  the  comparison  of  welfare  among 

individuals, demographics, and facilities. This work represents a first step in 

quantifying and systematically measuring welfare among captive cetaceans and can 

be used as a model for future development in zoos and aquaria, as well as a means 

to support benchmarking, industry best practices, and certification.

affective  states  comprising  of  more  than  just  basic  emotions.  Welfare  describes  a 

balance  of  positive  and  negative  affective  states  experienced  by  an  individual,  and 

this balance is a good indicator of how it perceives the surrounding environment. In 

this  chapter,  we  discuss  how  the  first  steps  in  cetacean  welfare  science  are  being 

taken  to  establish  this  as  a  discipline.  We  discuss  how  there  are  pertinent  areas  of 

cetology  that  merit  investigation  to  form  the  basis  of  possible  cetacean  welfare 

measures.  In  this  arena  of  welfare  assessment,  much  of  the  existing  work  comes 

from  farm  animal  science,  and  this  previous  work  also  offers  potential  tools  and 

techniques,  which  could  be  adapted  for  cetaceans.  In  this  chapter  we  review  these 

sources of information, make suggestions for potentially relevant investigations, and 

discuss how assessment of cetacean welfare might be accomplished.

Abstract  

Recent collaborative and independent studies on sea lions, seals and walruses have 

advanced  our  knowledge  and  sustained  interest  in  pinniped  welfare.  Nevertheless 

published  discussions  of  the  welfare  of  pinnipeds,  and  secondly  of  potential 

measures to assess their welfare, are, respectively, very few and non-existent. This 

chapter  aims  to  make  first  steps  in  the  discussion  on  assessing  pinniped  welfare, 

with the goal of stimulating future welfare investigation. Pinniped species are able to 

thrive in two opposing environments, the land/ice margin at the coast, and in the sea, 

and  these  animals  use  these  two  ‘domains’  for  different  functions.  Welfare 

measurement  is  concerned  with  the  outcome  of  an  animal’s  internal  and  external 

responses  to  its  environment,  and  pinniped  species’  evolutionary  biology  may  be 

especially  important  in  this  respect,  in  terms  of  our  understanding  of  the  animals’ 

responses  and  interactions  within  their  two  domains.  Pinnipeds  are  being  directly 

impacted  by  serious  anthropogenic  disturbances  in  the  wild,  including  human 

interference at established feeding and breeding grounds, hunting, entanglement and 

climate change, and are also often kept in captive collections. Feasible evaluations of 

welfare  can  therefore  be  assumed  to  have  potential  widespread  utility,  including 

applications benefitting the animals themselves.

Synchronised swimming makes 
dolphins more optimistic

Isabella Clegg 
PhD student in Dolphin Behaviour and Welfare, Université Paris 13 – USPC 

Some  people  say  the  glass  is  half-empty,  some  say  it’s  half-full  –  but  can 
animals also be optimistic or pessimistic? 

Recent  studies show  that  certain  animals  do  make  more  positive  or  negative 
judgements  depending  on  the  situation  and  their  emotional  state,  just  like 
humans. This phenomenon is called cognitive bias. 

Cognitive  bias  is  present  in  many  aspects  of  our  lives,  whenever  we  make 
decisions about events with an unknown outcome. It has been shown that our 
current emotional state can influence whether decisions are more positive or 
negative in nature: either we expect the best or prepare for the worst. 

Thanks  to  recent cognition  research,  we  can  test  this  in  animals  by  training 
them in a judgement task. 

Measuring optimism and pessimism 

A judgement task works like this: first the animal is taught what will happen 
when certain cues appear. 

For  instance,  if  we  place  a  bowl  in  the  left-hand  corner  of  a  room,  it  means 
they  will  receive  a  big  reward.  When  the  bowl  is  in  the  right-hand  position, 

 

 

	

	
this  means  the  animal  gets  no  reward,  or  something  bad  will  happen  (for 
example, a loud sound is played). Logically, the animal will run faster towards 
the positive cue and much slower towards the negative cue. 

Appendix						206	

After this priming, the bowl is placed in the middle of the room. If an animal 
still runs fast to the bowl, it is thought to be more “optimistic”, since it expects 
something positive to occur from an unknown event. 

Past  studies  involving  many  species  (for  example rats, dogs and bees)  have 
used this approach and shown that animals in poorer welfare situations, such 
as  those  in  barren  cages,  or  those  subjected  to  veterinary  exams  or  social 
isolation,  make  more  pessimistic 
in  enriched 
environments make more optimistic judgements. 

judgements.  Those 

These  experiments  lead  scientists  to  believe  that  cognitive  bias  testing  is  a 
valid way to discover the emotional state of the animal. However, these tests 
had never been applied to captive dolphins before. 

Optimistic dolphins 

At the Parc Astérix dolphinarium in France, I led a study to find out whether 
dolphins also had cognitive biases, and what might influence them. 

We  taught  the  parks’ eight  dolphins to  touch  a  target  and  return  to  their 
trainer. The dolphins then learnt that if the target was presented on one side 
of the pool, they would get a big herring (their favourite fish). If the target was 
on the other side of the pool, they would receive only applause and eye contact 
from the trainer. 

The dolphins were soon swimming faster when the target was in the “herring 
position”. It was then placed in the middle position and we measured the level 
of optimism of each dolphin by their swimming speed as they returned to the 
trainer.  Those  swimming  faster  back  to  the  trainer  were  thought  to  be  more 
optimistic as they are were probably expecting to receive a herring, while the 
slower swimmers were not as hopeful about getting a reward. 

The results showed that indeed, the dolphins had different levels of optimism 
and pessimism, which remained the same over repeated days of testing. 

But the most interesting discovery came when we compared the cognitive bias 
with  individual  observations  of  behaviour  taken  in  the  dolphins’  “free-time”, 
in between the sessions. 

 

	

	
In  both  the  wild  and  captive  environments,  dolphins  engage  in social 
behaviour.  Swimming  in  synchrony  is  thought  to  be  an  important affiliative 
behaviour which reinforces the bonding between individuals. 

Appendix						207	

In  the  park,  we  observed  that  those  dolphins  who  swam  in  synchrony  more 
often  were  also  the  ones  who  made  the  most  optimistic  decisions.  For 
example,  a  16-year-old  female  dolphin  was  seen  very  often  swimming  in 
synchrony  with  other  partners,  especially  her  mother,  and  during  the 
judgement  tests  she  swam  the  fastest  back  from  the  middle  target,  thus 
making an optimistic judgement. 

As highly  social animals,  this  isn’t  entirely  surprising,  but  the  link  between 
optimism,  positive  emotions  and  social  behaviour  has  proved  difficult  to 
measure  so  far.  Positive  social  behaviour  is  an  adaptation  that  is  thought  to 
help  the  dolphins  survive  in  the  wild,  for  example  in  the cooperative 
hunting behaviours seen in Florida. 

Sociability and emotions 

The findings of the cognitive bias study suggest that synchronised swimming 
is  linked  to  positive  emotional  states,  which  for  the  first  time  gives  us  an 
insight into the emotions linked to dolphins’ social interactions. 

Intrigued  by  the  results,  our  team  went  one  step  further  and  compared 
optimism levels to the social behaviour seen in the four months preceding the 
test.  We  had  taken  daily  observations  of  the  dolphins’  social  behaviour,  and 
measured the amount of time they spent swimming synchronously during the 
weeks before the test. 

We  found  that  the  most  optimistic  dolphins  were  also  those  who  had 
performed most synchronised swimming in the two months prior to the test, 
but  that  there  was  no  relation  between  optimism  and  the  behaviour  before 
that. This suggests that the optimism levels are linked to emotional states, as 
opposed  to  fixed  personality  characteristics.  The  emotional  states  are  likely 
driven  by  the  positive  social  behaviour  occurring  within  the  group  at  that 
time. 

Dolphins’ emotional states, and their overall welfare in captivity, have recently 
incited  much  interest  for  scientists  and  the  public.  The  authors  of  this  study 
believe that the level of synchronised swimming could be used as an indicator 
of emotional state, and thus could help to monitor and improve the animals’ 
social dynamics. 

 

	

	
Our study was small, and more work is needed to investigate the link between 
welfare and positive social behaviour, but it is encouraging that these types of 
studies can yield such fruitful results and enhance our knowledge of dolphins’ 
social lives.

Synchronised swimming 
seems to make dolphins 
more optimistic 

 
By Ramin Skibba 

Bottlenose dolphins that engage in synchronised swimming with their peers tend 
to see the glass as being half full. 

Some  of  these  dolphins  frequently  swim  in  tight-knit  groups,  and  they’re  the 

ones  who  appear  the  most  optimistic,  according  to  a  study  of  eight  captive 

animals. 

In the experiment, individual dolphins were trained to swim towards one of two 

targets.  They  were  taught  that  when  they  reach  the  left  one,  they  receive 

applause  and  eye  contact,  while  the  one  on  the  right  delivers  herring  –  the 
jackpot – and dolphins swim faster towards it. 

When  presented  with  a  new  and  ambiguous  middle  target,  some  dolphins  still 

swim  rather  fast,  presumably  hoping  they’ll  receive  another  tasty  herring, 

although it’s only a 50/50 chance. 

 

 
 

	

	
Those  were  dubbed  the  “optimistic”  dolphins,  and  the  analysis  found  that  they 

were the same animals who had participated in the most synchronised swimming 

recently:  moving  closely  alongside their  fellow  dolphins and  matching  their

movements. 

Social swimming 

Dolphins continue to make these optimistic judgements up to two months after 

frequent  synchronised  swimming  with  their  friends,  but  the  boost  fades  after

that. 

Swimming  together  is  an  important  social  activity  for  dolphins  that  increases 

bonding  between  them,  and  the  researchers  argue  that  it  could  be  linked  to 
positive emotions. 

“I think it’s the social behaviour that drives the dolphins’ optimistic decisions,” 

says Isabella Clegg, a zoologist at the University of Paris-North and lead author 

of the study. Social interactions are thought to be rewarding and associated with 

positive  views,  and  she  believes  her  study  of  synchronised  swimming  confirms 

“We  know  that  dolphins  in  the  wild  and  in  captivity  tend  to  use  synchronous 

swimming  as  a  form  of  bonding,  such  as  between  pairs  of  adult  dolphins  or 

mothers and calves,” says Adam Pack, a psychologist at the University of Hawaii 

at  Hilo.  “People  interpret  these  behaviours  as  reinforcing  close  relationships.” 

The  dolphins’  optimistic  behaviour  resembles  “cognitive  bias”:  how  humans 

judge  situations  differently  depending  on  their  social  environment.  People’s 

social  activity  affects  their  outlook  on  the  world,  and  something  similar  may 

happen among some animals, too. 

Kinder zoos 

Cognitive bias has been studied with laboratory rats, for example, by comparing 

those residing in enriched and barren cages. The dolphin study says it is the first 
test of cognitive bias in a marine mammal or a zoo-housed species. 

“This study could be used as a tool to probe aspects of animal welfare in captive 

environments,” says Lori Marino, a behavioural biologist at Emory University in 

Atlanta, Georgia. Zoo animals, for instance, don’t choose many aspects of their 

lives,  but  they  can  benefit  from  opportunities  for  social  activities  with  their 

peers, she says. 

Clegg  agrees.  Zookeepers  and  aquarists  could  use  this  to  monitor  how  many 

dolphins often swim together, and manage their practices accordingly. “In better 
welfare situations, animals judge [things] more optimistically,” she says.

Dolphins  Who  Hang  With  Mates 
Display a Positive Spin on Life 
Study  shows  dolphins  who  swim  together  display  positive

A few hours ago, when I was looking for some information on another topic, I 
came  across  an  essay  by Ramin  Skibba  called  "Synchronised  swimming 
seems  to  make  dolphins  more  optimistic."  The  caption  to  an  image 
accompanying the article reads, "Hanging with your mates may put a positive 
spin on life."

in Behavioural BrainResearch by  Dr. Isabella  Clegg  and  her  colleagues  titled 
"Bottlenose  dolphins  engaging  in  more  social  affiliative  behaviour  judge 
ambiguous cues more optimistically." I honestly didn't see the main message 
of  this  extremely  interesting  and  intriguing  study  until  I  saw  Mr.  Skibba's 
summary.

Cutting  to the  chase,  this  study shows "Bottlenose  dolphins  that  engage  in 
synchronised  swimming  with  their  peers  tend  to  see  the  glass  as  being  half 
full."  When  dolphins  swam  toward  an  object  on  the  left  they  received  eye 
contact  and  applause,  and  when  they  swam  toward  an  object  on  the  right, 
they  received  much-loved  herring.  When  they  were  offered  an  ambiguous 
target, the researchers showed that the dolphins who swam together were the 
more  optimistic  individuals  and  swam  faster  than  other  dolphins.  The  effect 
lasted around two months, after which it declined.

What  I  really  like  about  this  study  in  addition  to  showing  that  dolphins  who 
swim together display more optimism, is that it also has practical applications 
in  that  social  interactions  might  make  captivity  less  stressful  for  individuals 
who  are  able  to socialize with  peers.  Mr.  Skibba  concludes,  "Clegg  agrees. 
Zookeepers and aquarists could use this to monitor how many dolphins often 
swim  together,  and  manage  their  practices  accordingly.  'In  better  welfare

I  really  like  this  study  and  I  hope  other  researchers  will  follow  up  with 
additional  comparative  studies  on  other  species.  Social  interactions  can  be 
very positive for individuals in a wide variety of species, and not only can we 
learn  about  wild  animals,  but  also  those  who  are  forced  to  live  in  captive 
conditions where  they  have  little  to  no  freedom  to  make  choices  about  how 
they want and need to spend their time.

Suite  à  la présentation  du  LEEC (Laboratoire  d’Ethologie  Expérimentale  et  Comparée)  et  de 
l’éthologie, nous interrogeons aujourd’hui Isabella Clegg qui réalise sa thèse sur le bien-être des 
dauphins en captivité au Parc Astérix. 

Doctorante  au  LEEC,  Isabella  est  co-encadrée  par  madame  Fabienne  Delfour,  responsable 
scientifique  au  Delphinarium  du  Parc  Astérix,  et  Heiko  .G.  Rödel,  Directeur  du  LEEC.  Notons 
qu’elle  bénéficie  d’une  bourse  CIFRE,  ce  qui  signifie  que  le  Parc  Astérix  finance  sa  thèse,  une 
première pour une structure animalière. > En savoir plus sur la bourse CIFRE 

Dans  la  présente interview,  Isabella  Clegg  nous  partage  ses  premiers  résultats  sur  le  lien  entre 
l’optimisme et le niveau de sociabilisation. Un lien pour la première fois mesuré et prouvé chez le 
dauphin. 

Interview d’Isabella Clegg, doctorante au LEEC 

Qu’avez-vous fait avant d’être inscrite au LEEC ? J’ai d’abord fait une licence en Angleterre 
pendant laquelle j’ai étudié le comportement et le bien-être animal, puis un Master à l’université 
de  Miami  dans  laquelle  j’ai  étudié  la  biologie  marine.  Six  mois  après,  je  suis  arrivé  au  Parc 
Astérix pour réaliser ma thèse. 

Cela fait trois ans que vous êtes au LEEC, quel est l’objet de votre thèse ? Mon objectif est de 
trouver des mesures objectives du bien-être des dauphins en captivité. L’approche est la suivante : 
on  combine  la  mesure  du  comportement,  de  la  physiologie  et  de  la  cognition.  L’utilisation  de 
l’ensemble de ces mesures permet une meilleure fiabilité des résultats, contrairement à une seule. 

Comment  procédez-vous  à  la  mesure  du  bien-être  animal ?  J’ai  de  la  chance  d’être  au  Parc 
Astérix puisque je peux effectuer des observations quotidiennes auprès des dauphins. J’ai pu ainsi 
mieux prendre en compte leur état de bien-être, état que l’on détermine sur une période de longue 
durée. 

L’objet  de  la  première  étude  dans  le  cadre  de  ma  thèse  a  été  d’identifier  les  comportements  des 
dauphins.  Nous  voulions  connaître  leurs habitudes  avant  et  après  les  entraînements,  le  matin  et 
l’après-midi.  Après  plusieurs  observations,  nous  avons  pu  constater  que  les  dauphins  anticipent 
l’entraînement  et  qu’à  la  suite  de  ce  dernier  ils  pratiquent  des  comportements  sociaux  positifs. 
Autrement dit, ils nagent de façon synchronisée en groupe. 

Pour la suite de ma thèse, je me suis inspirée d’approches du bien-être appliquées à des animaux 
fermiers. Nous avons réalisé le test du « Biais cognitif », habituellement appliqué aux chiens, avec 

 

 

	

	
les dauphins du parc. C’est une première dans une structure animalière. Ce test nous a permis de 
mesurer l’émotion du dauphin, nous avons donc pu connaître son niveau d’optimisme et constater 
qu’il est élevé lorsqu’il pratique la nage synchronisée avec ses pairs. Ce qui revient à dire que le 
dauphin le plus optimiste est également celui qui nage le plus avec les autres. 

Appendix						215	

Quels  sont  les  moyens  dont  vous  disposez  au  Parc  Astérix ?  J’ai  le  droit  d’accéder  tous  les 
jours au delphinarium du Parc Astérix. De ce fait, je peux observer longtemps les dauphins afin de 
mieux comprendre leurs comportements. De plus, grâce aux soigneurs et à leur proximité avec les 
dauphins, je peux mettre en place différents exercices avec un système de récompense à la clef. Le 
test d’optimisme (précédemment cité) n’aurait pas été possible sans le travail des soigneurs. C’est 
avec eux que nous avons adapté le test au dauphin. 

Quel  est  le  but  de  ces  recherches ?  Autrement  dit,  quelles  seraient  les  applications  dans  la 
société  ?  J’espère  que  d’autres  delphinariums  verront  les  résultats  de  mes  recherches  et  les 
utiliseront  pour  le  bien-être  de  leurs  dauphins.  Par  exemple,  en  les  observant  simplement,  en 
regardant s’ils pratiquent la nage synchronisée, les delphinarium peuvent désormais mesurer leur 
niveau d’optimiste. Ils pourront donc connaître l’impact des exercices et des autres activités sur le 
bien-être des dauphins et ainsi, les ajuster de façon à ce que leurs dauphins se sentent mieux. 

En ce moment, nous menons une autre expérience avec les soigneurs. Nous souhaitons savoir si le 
dauphin préfère jouer dans le bassin ou interagir avec un soigneur. C’est l’exemple de recherche 
dont  les  résultats  peuvent  servir  à  d’autres  delphinariums,  mais  également  au  grand  public  qui 
souhaite mieux connaître la relation entre le dauphin et l’être humain. 

Allez-vous  continuer  à  étudier  les  dauphins  ?  L’intérêt  pour  moi  dans  la  recherche  se  porte 
notamment sur la transmission du savoir vers le grand public. Ma thèse se termine à la fin de cette 
année universitaire, suite à cela j’aimerais continuer mes recherches que ce soit avec des dauphins 
en captivité ou dans leur milieu naturel.

1.  Trainer-Dolphin relationship and its links with dolphin welfare 

A theoretical model constructed by I. Clegg (following discussions with X. Boivin and 

others) proposing how the trainers (animals caretakers) and dolphins might interact, 

and  how  these  intraspecific  encounters  might  impact  the  animals’  welfare.  Several 

sources  from  farm  and  zoo  Human-Animal  Relationship  research  were  used  to 

structure  the  elements  (Boivin  et  al.,  2003;  Hemsworth,  2003;  Hosey,  2008; 

Waiblinger et al., 2006). This model was not published but aided in the development 

of the study that resulted in Papers 5 and 6.
