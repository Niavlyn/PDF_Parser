The chemosensory abilities (i.e. taste, smell and trigeminal perception) of odontocete cetaceans are still widely
unknown. However, a better understanding of their potential use of these senses would not only improve our
knowledge of their behavioural ecology, but also allow us to develop behavioural enrichment strategies for
captive odontocetes using sensory stimulation. While studies on taste bud anatomy and taste receptor genes in
these animals have provided useful information, ultimately behavioural experiments are crucial to assess
whether odontocetes use their sense of taste in water. Go/no go and conditioning experiments in bottlenose
dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have previously shown that they can perceive basic tastes, but it is still unclear
whether they are able to detect food-related chemical mixtures. We thus designed a spontaneous choice
experiment using ﬂoating taste diﬀusers in order to test whether captive bottlenose dolphins could detect and
display attraction behaviours towards a natural ﬁsh taste stimulus. Four dolphins, two adult males and two
juvenile females, were involved in the experiment. Our results show that the juvenile females interacted with the
ﬁsh taste diﬀuser signiﬁcantly more than with the control. However, the adult males did not seem to make a
clear choice. Also, the juvenile females showed a signiﬁcantly greater level of motivation towards the test,
spending more time interacting with the diﬀusers and holding them in their open mouth more often than the
adult males. These ﬁndings corroborate previous behavioural studies suggesting that taste perception is
functional in bottlenose dolphins, at least in young individuals. They also suggest that the taste of their natural
prey could be attractive to them. Finally, the methodology used in this study proved to be easy to implement in
captive odontocetes and will allow for investigating further their use of taste in feeding and social contexts
without the need for conditioning experiments that require long periods of training. This experimental design
could also be included in behavioural enrichment initiatives in captive marine mammals.

1. Introduction

their environment

Animals gain information about

through a
variety of diﬀerent sensory modalities. In captive animals, knowledge
of a species’ sensory capabilities is important for a number of reasons.
Various sensory stimuli (or a lack thereof) can act as signiﬁcant
stressors for captive animals (Morgan and Tromborg, 2007). In addi-
tion, sensory enrichment using biologically relevant stimuli may be
used to stimulate ‘natural’ behavioural expression in captive animals
(Mills et al., 2010; Wells, 2009), and it may be possible to incorporate
natural sensory stimuli into cognitive enrichment strategies.

Various species of toothed whale (odontocetes), such as beluga
whales (Delphinapterus leucas), killer whales (Orcinus orca), and, in
particular, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), are held in captivity
in zoos and aquariums around the world (Clark et al., 2013). While we
are accumulating increasingly detailed knowledge about the sensory

systems of these animals, in particular audition and vision (see Kremers
et al., 2016a; for a recent review) very little is known about the
chemical senses (taste, smell and trigeminal perception) in odontocetes.
In terrestrial mammals, these senses are involved in a wide range of
biological functions such as foraging, reproduction and orientation.
This is also true for many marine vertebrates including ﬁsh, turtles,
birds and pinnipeds (Grassman and Owens, 1987; Hara, 1994; Nevitt
et al., 2004; Pitcher et al., 2011; Stoﬀel et al., 2015).

In contrast, odontocetes are thought to have very limited chemo-
sensory abilities (Lowell and Flanigan, 1980). For example, these
animals lack the canonical neuroanatomical structures necessary for
olfaction as found in other vertebrates, e.g., olfactory epithelium, bulbs,
nerves and tract (Jacobs et al., 1971; Oelschläger and Buhl, 2008),
although these structures may be present embryonically (Oelschläger
and Buhl, 2008). In addition, odontocetes also appear to have a poor
sense of taste. Juveniles possess small numbers of taste buds, which

diminish in number or even totally disappear in adults (Behrmann,
1988; Komatsu and Yamasaki, 1980; Kuznetzov, 1990; Li, 1983; Shindo
et al., 2008; Werth, 2004; Yoshimura and Kobayashi, 1997). Moreover,
they usually swallow their food whole (Perrin et al., 2009) and appear
to lack functional taste receptor genes for four of the ﬁve basic
vertebrate tastes (sweet, bitter, umami, sour, and salt; odontocetes
only have functional salt taste receptor genes) (Feng et al., 2014; Liu
et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2014). Because these animals are thought to
have such limited chemosensory abilities, very few studies have focused
on this sensory system in comparison to the large number of studies
performed on other modalities like audition or vision (e.g., Supin et al.,
2001; Thomas et al., 1992; Thomas and Kastelein, 1990)

The extent to which odontocetes can perceive chemical signals,
however, is still controversial. For example, while most of the taste
receptor genes (except those implicated in salt taste) are pseudogenized
in the bottlenose dolphin (Feng et al., 2014), this species has a well-
developed gustatory thalamus (Kruger, 1959). Behavioural observa-
tions have suggested that bottlenose dolphins, as well as other dolphin
species, have taste preferences and can potentially perceive chemical
signals from congeners’ secretions including faeces, urine and blood
(Dudzinski et al., 2009; Gubbins, 2002; Muraco and Kuczaj, 2015;
Norris et al., 1994). Indeed, in bottlenose dolphins, some of these
biological secretions (urine and faeces) can induce an autonomous
physiological response (such as an increase in heart rate, respiratory
rate and skin conductivity) when they are irrigated as dilute solutions in
the oral cavity (Kuznetzov, 1990).

Concerning the perception of the ﬁve basic tastes, experiments using
go/no go operant conditioning in bottlenose dolphins indicate that
these dolphins could detect at least four of them (sweet, salt, bitter and
sour) at thresholds similar to those of humans (Friedl et al., 1990;
Kuznetzov, 1990). Kuznetzov (1990) termed this ability “quasi-olfac-
tion” instead of gustation, mainly because the dolphins seemed to
perceive in their oral cavity some compounds that are usually perceived
through olfaction in terrestrial mammals. In a recent preliminary study,
food preference was also tested in the same species (Kremers et al.,
2016b), the results of which suggest that bottlenose dolphins can
discriminate artiﬁcial ﬁsh ﬂavour from shrimp ﬂavour or water.
However, while these aforementioned studies using conditioning and/
or go/no go experiments inform us about the ability of bottlenose
dolphins to perceive some chemical compounds, they give limited
information about whether or not these compounds will naturally
inﬂuence their behaviour.

In this study, we implemented an experiment using captive bot-
tlenose dolphins where the animals were free to spontaneously interact
with two devices (ﬂoating diﬀusers containing ice cubes consisting of
either natural ﬁsh mixture or a control solution) without any condi-
tioned behaviour. This innovative, direct choice experiment was based
on this species’ spontaneous tendency to play with ﬂoating objects
(Greene et al., 2011). We hypothesized that if the dolphins can
discriminate the taste diﬀuser from the control, they would interact
with them diﬀerently. Furthermore, if they perceive the food-related
stimulus (ﬁsh mixture solution) as biologically relevant, the animals
should display more attraction/interaction behaviours towards the
taste diﬀuser compared to the control. Bottlenose dolphins were the
focus of this study because most of the previous behavioural (con-
ditioning) experiments on odontocetes’ chemoreception have been
performed on this species. As well as providing fundamental biological
information, this study on the chemoreceptive capabilities of captive
bottlenose dolphins could contribute to improve the welfare of such
animals in captivity and above all, to contribute to the conservation and
management of wild populations.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study animals and facilities

This study was performed at Marineland, Antibes, France, and
involved four captive-born bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).
Two of the dolphins (A1 and A2, aged 22 and 24 years old, respectively)
were adult males and the other two were juvenile females (J1 and J2,
aged 7 and 4, respectively). These animals were kept together in a
social group in a main lagoon pool (43 × 40 m with a maximum depth
of 4 m) with another eight-year-old male which was not included in the
experiment because of its tendency to destroy ﬂoating objects. None of
the dolphins housed in the lagoon pool were part of the daily shows,
which made them available for behavioural experiments.

2.2. Chemical stimuli

A natural ﬁsh taste stimulus (Fish) and a control stimulus (Control)
were used. Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) was chosen as the ﬁsh
stimulus because this species had already been included in the diet of
the dolphins, thus preventing a neophobic reaction. At the same time,
as the dolphins’ regular diet consisted mostly of capelin (Mallotis
villosus) and sprat (Sprattus spp.), we expected the dolphins to have a
higher level of motivation towards a less-common ﬁsh stimulus (e.g.,
Epstein et al., 2007). The Fish solution was prepared by mixing 500 g of
fresh mackerel in commercial spring water (Cristaline
, Saint Yorre,
France) to a ﬁnal volume of 1300 ml. This ﬁsh mixture was then ﬁltered
through a 200 μm sieve and 10 ml of red dye (natural beetroot extract,
Terre Exotique, Rochecorbon, France) was added to produce a homo-
genous and uniformly coloured solution. For the Control solution, the
spring water was coloured with the red dye in the same concentration
as the ﬁsh solution. Ice cubes were prepared by freezing 100 ml of each
solution at −20 °C for at least 72 h, which allowed the destruction of
potential parasites in the ﬁsh mixture.

®

Two stimulus presentation devices, or ‘diﬀusers’ were built using
modiﬁed commercially available ﬂoating chlorine diﬀusers for outdoor
swimming pools, painted either red or blue (RAL 3000 and RAL 5019
respectively, Nuance, Motip Dupli, GmbH, Hassmersheim, Germany) to
assist identiﬁcation during video analysis (Fig. 1). The hue of these two
colours was chosen because they had identical brightness, so avoiding a
possible visual bias (bottlenose dolphins are cone monochromats;
Fasick et al., 1998). During each experimental trial, each diﬀuser
contained one 100 ml ice cube that was not visible through the narrow
openings at the bottom. A rubber band was added to the screw-on cap
so it remained tightly in place during manipulation by the subjects. In
order to habituate the dolphins to the diﬀusers prior to the start of the
trials, they were introduced while empty to the dolphins’ pool for ﬁve
minutes twice a day on the two consecutive days before the start of the
trials.

2.3. Experimental design

Each spontaneous choice experiment consisted of a four-minute trial
conducted in an experimental pool (11 × 11 m, 2.5 m deep) that was
separated from the lagoon pool by a stainless steel gate. In order to
participate in a trial, each dolphin was asked by a trainer to enter alone
the experimental pool using a visual signal (pointing arm), while the
others remained in the lagoon pool. A total of 48 trials were undertaken
by testing each individual during 12 sessions across 10 days. The trials
were run mostly during the late morning between 10:00 and 13:00, but
also during the afternoon between 15:00 and 16:30. The dolphins were
fed in the lagoon pool a light meal of ﬁsh (a quarter of their daily
ration) on average 108 min (range: 15–213 min) before their participa-
tion in the experiment, which replaced the routine training sessions.
The temperature of the air and water varied between 14 and 17 °C and
15–17 °C, respectively. The trials were performed with the assistance of

(1) ‘bite’ (the dolphin holds the diﬀuser in its mouth); (2) ‘push’ (the
dolphin pushes the diﬀuser using its rostrum); and (3) ‘throw-follow’
(the dolphin throws the diﬀuser away using its mouth and then swims
back to it). The total exploration time was deﬁned as the total time of
interaction with both diﬀusers and was used as an indicator of the
exposure of the dolphins to both the stimulus and the control. The taste
preference (P) was calculated as the diﬀerence in the duration of all the
interactions between the Fish and the Control stimuli. The number of
switches between the diﬀusers (where the dolphin goes from one
diﬀuser to the other) was also measured as a potential indicator of
the dolphins’ interest in ﬁnding the chemical cue.

2.5. Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were carried out using R 3.1.2 (R Development
Core Team 2015). Arithmetic means and ± standard errors are pre-
sented. The data were tested for normality using a Shapiro–Wilk test
prior to all analyses. Non-normal distributions were transformed using
either square-root (exploration time and number of switches) or arcsine
(proportion of biting behaviour) transformations. The eﬀects of the trial
session and the prandial state on the behavioural parameters were
analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient and the eﬀects of both
environmental (weather conditions, prandial state) and protocol (pre-
sentation side and colour of the Fish diﬀuser, identity of the trainer)
variables were assessed using Kruskal Wallis’ H-test. The diﬀerences in
these parameters between the two age/sex groups (adult/male and
juvenile/female) were tested using two-tailed Student’s t-tests. Taste
preference was tested against the theoretical value of zero using a
Student’s t-test.

2.6. Ethical approval

This experiment was approved by the French national ethical
committee (Comité Consultatif National d'Ethique, permit APAFIS
#5392-20l6051717525952v3) and was
in accordance with the
European directive 86/609/CEE. The subjects’ participation in research
was entirely voluntary, with the experiment described here replacing
routine training sessions.

3. Results

3.1. Environmental and protocol variables

None of the measured behavioural parameters (preference, time of
exploration, and number of switches) was signiﬁcantly aﬀected by any
of the environmental and protocol variables (Table 1).

3.2. Behavioural interactions

Bite was by far the most common behavioural interaction, account-
ing for on average 70.0 ± 4.1% of the total interactions across the four
dolphins. The two juvenile females displayed bite behaviour signiﬁ-
cantly more frequently than the two adult males (81% of the interac-
tions vs. 60% in the juvenile females and adult males, respectively;
t = 2.37; df = 32.5; P = 0.02; Student’s two-tailed t-test on arcsines,
Fig. 2a). The push behaviour was observed more frequently in adult
males (31.4% vs. 13.6%; t = 2.39; df = 22.4; P = 0.03; Student’s two-
tailed t-test on arcsines, Fig. 2b) while there was no diﬀerence in the
throw-follow behaviour between the two groups (t = 1.35; df = 28.6;
P = 0.19; Student’s two-tailed t-test on arcsines, Fig. 2c).

3.3. Total exploration time

The four dolphins manipulated both diﬀusers extensively, with an
average of 19.2 ± 2.1 contacts per trial. On average, total exploration
time was signiﬁcantly higher in the juvenile females than in the adult

6 trainers although two trainers were involved in only one trial each.
We utilized two established command signals used by the trainers for
many years, ‘free-time’ (the trainer indicates the training session has
stopped) and ‘retrieve’ (the trainers ask the dolphin to retrieve an item
in the pool). At the beginning of each trial, the dolphin stationed in
front of a blind-folded trainer (starting place), while the two diﬀusers
(Fish and Control) were placed by an experimenter at the opposite side
of the pool equidistant from the starting place. The identity of the
dolphin, the colour of the Fish and Control taste diﬀusers (red or blue)
as well as their position (to the left or to the right of the subject) were
all chosen in a random balanced order to avoid a side- or colour-
preference eﬀect. Once the trainer gave the dolphin the signal for free
time and walked away, the dolphin was left alone to freely interact with
the two diﬀusers for the whole duration of the trial. The movements
and the behaviour of the dolphin during each trial were recorded using
two GoPro digital cameras (GoPro Hero 4 Black Edition, GoPro Inc., San
Mateo, CA, USA) placed facing in opposite directions above the pool.
Additional environmental data were also recorded to control for their
respective inﬂuence on the dolphins’ behaviours,
including their
prandial state (i.e., the amount of time since their last meal), the
weather conditions (presence of rain or wind > 10 km/h), and the
identity of the trainer. After four minutes, the trainer came back and,
again using signals, asked the dolphin to retrieve both diﬀusers. The
dolphin was rewarded with one ﬁsh upon retrieving the diﬀusers and
the keeper asked to transfer to the lagoon pool after the gate was
opened. The presence of a remaining ice cube of a similar size in both
diﬀusers was then checked to conﬁrm that there was no temperature
diﬀerence around the two diﬀusers during the experiment.

2.4. Data collection

The video recordings were analyzed by a blind experimenter.
Firstly, trials deemed as invalid due to a protocol problem (e.g., a
diﬀuser was opened by the dolphin or became stuck in the pool
skimmer, or the trainer used an incorrect command signal sequence)
were identiﬁed and discarded. For the remaining 37 valid trials (10
trials each for A1 and A2, 9 and 8 for J2 and J1, respectively), the
number and duration of the behavioural interactions with each diﬀuser
were measured. These interactions were divided into three categories:

t = 2.81,
df = 32.5; P = 0.008; Student’s two-tailed t-test on square roots,
Fig. 3a). The exploration time did not change throughout the sessions
in both groups (Pearson's r2 = 0.003 on square roots, P = 0.76;
Fig. 3b).

3.4. Taste preference

On average, the taste preference P (i.e. the diﬀerence in the time
spent with the Fish diﬀuser and the Control) was 18.4 ± 17.1 s across
the four animals but this did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from 0 (t = 1.079;
df = 36; P = 0.29; one sample Student’s two-tailed t-test). However,
we observed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in taste preference between the two
age/sex groups. With the mature males, no diﬀerence was found in the
time spent with each diﬀuser (t = 1.014; df = 19, P = 0.32; one
sample Student’s two-tailed t-test) while the two juvenile females
showed a signiﬁcant preference towards the Fish diﬀuser: they inter-
acted about one minute more with the Fish diﬀuser than with the
Control diﬀuser (107.8 vs. 45.3 s; t = 2.345; df = 16; P = 0.03; one
sample Student’s two-tailed t-test) resulting in an average taste
preference P of 62.5 ± 26.7 s (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained
when considering the number of contacts with the ﬂoaters instead of
the time spent interacting with them (data not shown). There was no
signiﬁcant change in taste preference through the diﬀerent trial sessions
in adult males or in juvenile females (Pearson's r2 = 0.10; P = 0.18 and
r2 = 9.10

−4; P = 0.91, respectively) (Fig. 5).

3.5. Switches

The dolphins switched between the two diﬀusers 2.4 ± 0.49 times
per trial on average with no diﬀerence found between the two age/sex
categories (t = 0.92, df = 28.2; P = 0.37; Student’s t-test (two-tailed)
on square roots). However, we observed a progressive decline in the
number of switches through the trial sessions (Pearson's r2 = 0.17;
P = 0.01).

3.6. Correlations between behavioural parameters

We observed only two correlations between the measured beha-
vioural parameters in the two age/sex groups. Preference was nega-
tively correlated with the number of switches in juvenile females
(Pearson's r2 = 0.23; P = 0.05) as well as with the exploration time
in adult males (Pearson's r2 = 0.21; P = 0.04) (Table 2).

4. Discussion

In previous studies on taste perception in bottlenose dolphins, only
pure taste compounds such as citric acid, sodium chloride or sucrose
(Friedl et al., 1990; Kuznetzov, 1990) or artiﬁcial ﬂavours (Kremers
et al., 2016b) were tested. In contrast, here we report for the ﬁrst time
the perception of a complex, food-related taste in bottlenose dolphins,

at least in one age/sex class. Indeed, our results strongly suggest that
the juvenile females we tested discriminated the ﬁsh taste, as they had
signiﬁcantly more contacts and higher time of interaction with the Fish
diﬀuser than with the Control diﬀuser. It is also noteworthy to mention
that the trials were performed without conditioning and using single
individuals, allowing a free spontaneous exploration of the stimuli
without any social bias due to hierarchical structure in captive animals.
Regarding the compounds that are potentially perceived in the ﬁsh
mixture, several hypotheses might be considered. First, although the
salt concentration in the ﬁsh mixture (estimated to be 0.07 M based on
Bhuiyan et al.'s (1986)) measure of the salt concentration in raw
Atlantic mackerel) was slightly below the behaviourally-determined
sodium chloride detection threshold reported in bottlenose dolphins
(0.1–0.3 M) (Friedl et al., 1990; Kuznetzov, 1990) it was much higher
−4 M). This diﬀerence in salt
than in the control solution (8.1 × 10
concentration may thus have played a role in the discrimination, as the
salt receptor genes have all been shown to be functional
in the
bottlenose dolphin (Feng et al., 2014). Moreover, trimethylamine
(TMA) is also present at high concentrations in raw ﬁsh including
mackerel (Ahn et al., 2014) and has been found to be perceived by
bottlenose dolphins when perfused in their mouth at a concentration of
−2 M (Kuznetzov, 1990). While the taste receptor type usually
3.4 × 10
implicated in the detection of trace-amines in mammals has been lost in
this species (Kishida et al., 2015), TMA may be perceived through
another neural pathway such as the trigeminal nerve, as has been
shown to be the case in humans and mice (van Thriel et al., 2006; Willis
and Morris, 2013). While sodium chloride and TMA are two potential
candidates, many other chemical compounds contained in the ﬁsh
mixture may have contributed, either individually or in combination, to
the taste discrimination in juvenile females.

In contrast to the juvenile female dolphins, the two adult males did
not discriminate between the two diﬀusers. This could be linked to a
lower chemical sensitivity related to either sex or age. In primates, for
example, it has been suggested that higher taste acuity in females could
be linked to a higher density of fungiform papillae on the tongue
(Muchlinski et al., 2011). However, there has been no report of sexual
diﬀerence in the gustatory structures in odontocetes so far, although
unfortunately the sex of the individuals investigated is rarely men-
tioned in the few previous studies on taste perception in bottlenose
dolphins. In the recent study by Kremers et al. (2016b), both male and
female bottlenose dolphins were tested and the authors found no
apparent diﬀerences between sexes regarding taste discrimination.

A more likely explanation for the apparent lack of discrimination
between the ﬁsh mixture and the control in the adult males is age, given
that the adult males were, on average, approximately four times older
than the juvenile females. A similar decline in taste sensitivity has also
been documented in other mammal species including humans and rats
(Kurt Thaw, 1996; Mojet et al., 2001). Anatomical studies in bottlenose
dolphins have suggested that taste buds progressively degenerate in
adults as their presence was described in the pits located at the base of
the tongue of a subadult and in 2–3 year-old calves, but not in mature

123

Yamasaki, 1980; Shindo et al., 2008). Therefore the discrimination
abilities of the two juvenile females included in the present study, aged
4 and 7, may reﬂect a higher chemical sensitivity, possibly related to
the presence of a larger number of functional taste buds. Taste thresh-
olds have yet to be determined for juvenile bottlenose dolphins, but our
results, as well as previous anatomical ﬁndings, suggest they are likely
to be lower than those already reported in adults using go/no
experiments (Friedl et al., 1990; Kuznetzov, 1990).

In addition to our discoveries regarding the ability of bottlenose
dolphins to perceive a complex-food mixture using taste, the main
feature of our study was to assess whether this chemoreceptive ability
could inﬂuence their behaviour. For this reason, we chose to evaluate
the spontaneous behavioural responses of the dolphins, instead of using
operant conditioning techniques. Our results suggest that not only were
juvenile females able to discriminate the ﬁsh taste from the control, but
that they were also attracted by the ﬁsh mixture, as shown by the
higher time of interaction recorded for these animals. We also observed
a diﬀerence in behaviours between the adult males and the juvenile
females that could explain partly the above-mentioned diﬀerence in
perception between these two groups. Indeed, the juvenile females
displayed a higher interest in the task in general compared to the adult
males: they spent more time exploring the two diﬀusers and exhibited
more biting behaviour. This result is not surprising as juvenile dolphins
have previously been shown to engage in object play signiﬁcantly more
than adults (Greene et al., 2011). It may also explain why, on two
occasions, one of the juvenile females (J1) was able to open the tightly
screwed cap of the Fish diﬀuser and then swallow the remaining ice
cube it contained. This happened only twice, so this unexpected event
was not statistically exploitable and, as explained previously, the two
trials in question were removed from the data analysis.

In general, both the adult males and the juvenile females showed a
progressive decline in motivation to perform the experimental task, as
suggested by the signiﬁcant decline in the number of switches through
the sessions. The number of switches may also be related to the
performance in the discrimination task as it was negatively correlated
to preference only in juvenile females; they tended to stick to their
choice (i.e. switch less) when they found the Fish diﬀuser. This pattern
appears similar to the “win-stay, lose-shift” strategy which involves a
stimulus-reward association and is well documented in laboratory
animals including mammals, birds and ﬁshes (Emery, 2006; Evenden
and Robbins, 1984; Heydarnejad and Purser, 2016). Wild bottlenose
dolphins have been shown to use this behaviour during foraging: they
tend to stay in patchy concentrations of nearshore preys until the local
resource has been depleted and then travel in search of a new optimal
site (Defran et al., 1999). In primates, a natural tendency to switch
more between choices when the reward intensity decreases has also
been described and linked to the stimulation of the parietal cortex
(Kubanek and Snyder, 2017), a brain region that is also well developed
in bottlenose dolphins (Jacobs et al., 1971). Increasing the animals’
motivation to play with the diﬀusers may therefore improve their
performance throughout the entire duration of the experiment via an
increase in their exposure to the taste stimuli. One simple method of
achieving this could be to reward them at the end of each trial by giving
them the tasty ice cube to eat.

This study demonstrated that our methodological design is appro-
priate to investigate bottlenose dolphins’ chemosensory abilities, since
the dolphins extensively manipulated the ﬂoating diﬀusers with their
mouths. As it was also easy to implement, this experimental approach
could be used as a complementary approach to operant conditioning
experiments that require long training periods working with particu-
larly attentive animals. Using the methodology described here, a wide
range of putatively relevant chemical cues could now be screened,
including food-related individual chemicals, or urine extracts that are
believed to contain sex pheromones (Muraco and Kuczaj, 2015). The
investigation of potential chemical deterrents would also be valuable
for use in conjunction with pingers in the ﬁshing industry (Hamer et al.,

females (t = 2.37; df = 32.5; P = 0.02; Student’s two-tailed t-test on arcsines). (b) The
‘push’ behaviour was proportionally more frequent in the adult males than in the juvenile

adults (Kuznetzov, 1990; Yoshimura and Kobayashi, 1997). While more
anatomical studies are needed to determine the chronology of this
process, the apparently greater taste sensitivity observed in young
individuals may be of great ecological importance as it could allow
them to taste milk during the 2-year lactation period, as well as to
discriminate food as they learn how to catch live prey (Komatsu and
Yamasaki, 1980). A similar process of progressive taste bud degenera-
tion was also described in other species of toothed whale (Komatsu and

to the animals,

In conclusion,

in this study we have designed and tested an
innovative protocol to study the use of chemoreception in captive
bottlenose dolphins. Our results corroborate with the very few previous
behavioural studies on this subject (Friedl et al., 1990; Kuznetzov,
1990), suggesting that bottlenose dolphins can indeed perceive chemi-
cal compounds. In addition, we have shown that a ﬁsh mixture can be
attractive, at least for juvenile females, which provides strong evidence
that chemical stimuli could be involved in foraging behaviour in
complement with other sensory modalities. Further studies are now
required, focusing on wild dolphins that both live in contact with the
complex mixture of chemicals present in the marine environment and
exhibit natural foraging behaviours. Our team is currently implement-

From an animal welfare point of view, the present spontaneous
choice protocol could also be used as part of an enrichment program for
captive dolphins raised in a relatively sterile, captive environment with
a low chemical diversity (Wells, 2009). Such sensory stimulations are
now becoming increasingly encouraged in zoos and aquariums (Mills
et al., 2010; Wells, 2009), and may be especially important in marine
mammals that usually cannot exhibit their natural feeding behaviours
as they are fed dead ﬁsh, mostly as a reward after the successful
completion of a conditioned task (Clark, 2013). Rather than being

ing ﬁeld experiments using protocols adapted from the research on
chemoreception in marine birds (e.g., Nevitt et al., 2004). We anticipate
that, as it has been the case in birds (e.g. Baldwin et al., 2014; Caro
et al., 2015), a combination of these behavioural approaches with
further investigations on their neuroanatomical and molecular bases
may reveal that chemosensory systems play a more signiﬁcant role in
the behavioural ecology of odontocetes (and indeed other cetaceans)
than has been previously thought.
